No, I'm not talking about the Presidential Election!  I'm talking (again) about Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>TUAW recently wrote about the <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/11/06/lessons-from-sandy-crashplan-and-the-importance-of-off-site-bac/">importance of off-site backup</a>. I wanted to chime in with my personal story.</p><p>Many years ago, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Firestorm_of_1991">large firestorm</a> that destroyed thousands of houses and apartments. And I was living within the evacuation zone. And in my home office was the <em>only copy</em> of some program code I had spent <em>years</em> working on.</p><p>I was actually quite religious about backing up my work! (In those days, we didn't have Apple's Time Machine. I backed up onto 44-Megabyte <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syquest">Syquest</a> cartridges.) The problem was that both the main computer <em>and</em> the backup were sitting on my desk.</p><p>"No worries," you may say.  "Just grab the disks on the way out the door — problem solved!" Except that I was actually away that day, so by the time the area was closed off, I couldn't get back to my house to grab anything precious.</p><p>That was the day that I became aware of the importance of off-site backups.</p><p>Fortunately, the fire was contained and I got lucky. But I still shudder to think of how much work would have been lost.</p><p>The moral of the story is that you, dear reader, really ought to get something set up for offsite backup. You probably have a whole lot of stuff that, if lost due to earthquake, house fire, hurricane, flood, robbery or other unfortunate event, would really bum you out.</p><p>The aforementioned TUAW article was big on CrashPlan. I've actually tried that but I wasn't impressed. It seemed like a non-Mac app trying to masquerade as a Mac app.  It was just klunky. Maybe it has improved, but I didn't like it back then.</p><p>The Internet-based service that I use and enjoy is <a href="http://www.backblaze.com/">BackBlaze</a>. It's inexpensive ($50/year), and it's well-integrated into Mac OS X. Once it's going, I usually don't have to think about it.</p><p>I highly recommend setting this up!  Think of it as insurance.  (However, if you are working with a <em>lot</em> of data, like video work, and you don't have a ultra-fast Internet connection, you may want to start out your backup by filling up a spare hard drive with your data and leaving it in the care of an out-of-town friend. It might take <em>weeks or months</em> to get your data finshed uploading to a remote backup service! It would be better if you were secured from the get-go.)</p><p>BackBlaze has saved my proverbial butt more than once, though not due to anything as dramatic as fire or flood. A few months ago, a hard drive failed on my main Mac.  I wasn't worried about my data, because I use Time Machine for local backup. (Also important!)  I was ready to just restore from my Time Machine drive, when I discovered that the backup had somehow gotten deactivated a while back. My Time Machine backup was way, way out of date.</p><p><strong>But my Backblaze backup was current! I ordered a hard drive filled with my data to be shipped to me, and I was completely back in business.</strong></p><p>So don't say I didn't warn you. Get your data backed up, offsite!</p><p style="text-align: right; ">(Photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/19942094@N00/8156668002/">Randy Le'Moine Photography</a>)</p></div>
