									<div class="article-summary"><p>Smashing Magazine today published a blog post <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/26/password-masking-hurt-signup-form/">Better Password Masking For Sign-Up Forms</a>. It suggests that a masked password (where the letters are replaced with ••••••) isn't such a great idea for making an account because you can't see what you have typed. Even if you are asked to enter a new password a second time, it still leaves the possiblity of error.</p><p>One suggestion it makes is to unmask the password when the field is focused. That's an intresting idea, but not a great idea if there is a curious person looking over your shoulder.</p><p>The final suggesion is a checkbox, where the user can choose whether to mask or unmask the password. That's probably the best compromise, since it lets the person typing the password control things.</p><p>(In fact, we're doing something like that on the upcoming version of <a href="http://www.sandvox.com/">Sandvox</a> where you are prompted for a password to access a server where your website will be hosted.)</p><p>The problem with this approach is that it's up to the creator of the web form to implement that behavior. It's also kind of klunky because it's not really obvious where the checkbox should be placed. Below the field? Above it? To the side?</p><p>What if, instead, there came into being an adjustment to the password input control on desktop computers that just included the mask/no-mask option in it?</p><p>(Here's a super-quick mockup.)</p>

									<div class="article-summary"><p>I recently <a href="../i-heart-stripe-credit-card.html">wrote a post</a> about how much I love <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, and why we changed <a href="https://secure.karelia.com/buy_now/">Karelia Software's online store</a> to use Stripe to process credit cards for people purchasing <a href="http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/">Sandvox</a>.</p><p>This is a followup to that, describing what we did to build our online store, and what decisions came into play for its user experience. (In another followup post, I'll discuss more of the back-end pieces we're using.)</p><p>When I realized that we could do just about anything we wanted to collect payments without the limitations we had before, I started looking around at a lot of online stores. I visited websites of fellow indie developers. I looked at the big online retailers. I looked at large retailers with an online presence.</p><p>And you know what? Everybody seems to have a different way to collect payments.</p><p>For example: some sites take you through multiple steps as you fill in your information. Fill in some fields, click a button to go to the next page, fill out another page or two, and eventually you're done. Others, on the other hand, collect all the information at once, with a single submit button at the bottom.</p><p>Different sellers handle input validation and errors differently. Some are proactive, offering helpful suggestions along the way if it looks like you have made a mistake; others wait until you have submitted the form to provide any error messages for you to collect.</p><p>After looking at examples and reading some online articles about payment form best practices, I started working on some iterations and refining them with Terrence's and Mike's input.</p><p>One overarching goal was to keep the form looking very friendly and simple, but allow for some more complicated scenarios (such as handling coupons or purchasing a gift license).</p><a href="https://secure.karelia.com/buy_now/" class="first narrow right imageLink"><span data-img-src="../_Media/karelia-store-sections_med.png" data-img-src-hr="../_Media/karelia-store-sections_med_hr.png" data-alt="karelia store sections" data-width="295" data-height="338" style="width:295px; height:338px;" class="graphic-container">

											</span>
										</a><p>First off, I decided that we wanted a single-step form; it seems to me that the fewer steps there are, the fewer chances we will lose somebody along the way. We wanted to make sure there were plenty of explanations of what the input fields are for, and <em>why we need them</em>. We wanted as much real-time input validation as possible so that there would be a live status update as the visitor clicks from field to field. (More on that in the followup post.)</p><p>To keep the more advanced options out of the way, we used simple text links (prefixed with a right-facing disclosure triangle) to allow additional sections to be revealed only if needed.</p><p>We put plenty of explanatory text below each field, to provide context for each input. That text even adapts as needed when additional options are disclosed. (Example: the explanation for "Your Name" changes if an advanced section is disclosed.)</p><p>Though the inputs are all collected in a single form submission, we felt it was important to group the similar types of input together into discreet chunks. We came up with three main sections: What the visitor is buying — from this a price is calculated. Then, who the license is for. Finally, the actual payment. </p><p>As I mentioned in my previous post, we wanted to keep PayPal an an option as well. So after a few iterations, we came on the idea of putting the PayPal button off to the side, at the top of the section where we deal with payment. This lets the visitor choose how to pay after we've collected the other information we need. The normal path is to continue and enter the credit card information, but they can veer off that path and use PayPal instead. This approach seems to work pretty well.</p><p>To reassure the visitor that this form is safe, we use the word "secure" above the payment section and feature a lock icon if it's an HTTPS connection. Plus, we link to Stripe and their <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security">security page</a> at the bottom.</p><p>In the field for the credit card number, we do something clever inspired by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>'s payment form. Like GitHub, we show icons for the credit cards that Stripe can process. But as the visitor types in a number, the first couple of digits indicate which type of card they are using, so we highlight the card they are using and fade out the others. No point in asking them what type of card they are using; this approach means one less step for the visitor to take, but it visually reinforces the card that they are using.</p><p>Naming and explaining the field for the 3- or 4-digit CVC/CVV2 code is never easy, and it varies greatly from website to website. We decided to call it "verification code", explain it below the input field, and provide a little thumbnail for where it can be found on a typical credit card.</p><p>Since this code is on the back of most cards but on the front of Amex cards, we do something kind of fun. If you enter an Amex number — try typing "34" in the Card Number field — we animate the card to flip over to show the front of an Amex card. (Also, we highlight the explanatory text referring to the Amex location.) <a href="https://secure.karelia.com/buy_now/">Try it!</a></p><p>That covers most of the design decisions for how to present the credit card input form. Next time around I'll describe what we are doing on the back end to deal with validation, internationalization, and dealing with unfinished transactions.</p><p><em>For the comments: How might you improve this form? (Despite the title, I don't think this is perfect by any means, and maybe there are more improvements we can make to it!) What are some other nice things that companies have done for their payment forms?</em></p>

									<div class="article-summary"><p><em>[Note: If you are reading this via RSS, you're better off opening the page so you get the proper photo viewer.]</em></p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I read <a href="http://www.jasperfforde.com/grey/">Shades of Grey</a>, a novel by Jasper Fforde (author of the <em>Thursday Next</em> books).</p><p>It was just such a cool book. I just can't stop thinking about it.</p><p>Have you ever read a book, and then wished you could see a movie version of it? This is one of those books.</p><p>The story is a vaguely dystopian future England, where people live in a social hierarchy separated by color: a <em>colortocracy</em>. No, not skin color, but their eyes. No, not the color of their eyes [hat-tip to <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie_I">Haile Selassie</a>] but people's color <em>perception</em>. Based on what color or colors you can see depends on where you are on the social strata. Purples (who can see red, blue and purple combinations thereof) are at the top; Reds are at the bottom. And greys are the untouchables.</p><p>You should read the book.  Warning, though: it's the first of a trilogy and the next part isn't due until … 2015. Yeah.</p><p>In the meantime, I have gotten somewhat obsessed with what it must be like to only be able to see a part of the spectrum. If somebody were to make a movie of it (say, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002657/">Gary Ross</a>, who did <em>Pleasantville</em>), viewers would probably want to see the perspective of various characters in the book.</p><span data-img-src="../_Media/photoshop-curve_med.png" data-img-src-hr="../_Media/photoshop-curve_med_hr.png" data-alt="photoshop curve" data-width="64" data-height="64" style="width:64px; height:64px;" class="first narrow right graphic-container">
											<noscript><img src="../_Media/photoshop-curve_med.png" alt="photoshop curve" width="64" height="64" /></noscript>
										</span><p>So after some digging around, I finally figured out how to do it, using PhotoShop and Lab color mode. For a "blue" photo, for example, I'd set the "a" channel to 50% gray to remove all red and green, and apply a curve like this to remove all the yellow from the photo.</p><p>The result is something like this. A Blue would really appreciate the sky!</p>

I hear there are fairies in Portland, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, New York, and so forth. I heard talk of a San Francisco one coming soon too.</p><p>There is so much going on!  I took this <a href="http://www.gopano.com/">GoPano</a> video of a typical scene.  Near me was a station where (mostly kids) could build popsicle stick structures and then test out their stability on earthquake simulations of different soil types, air-pressure-powered paper tube rocket making and launching, an outdoor wood-fire oven where people could make pretzels, a solar oven demonstration (waiting for the sun to come out), and an art space.</p>

We're building bonds that are much stronger than the occasional "hi" while out walking the dog, or the annual "block sale" that brings nearly everybody out and about.</p><p>The turnout of the happy hour varies from week to week, so it's never the same.</p><p>It turns out that this phenomonon is not unique to our street. See, for instance, <a href="http://thepiesthatbind.wordpress.com/2010/09/24/front-yard-happy%C2%A0hour/">this</a>, <a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/how-organize-neighborhood-happy-hour-6002228.html?cat=7">this</a>, <a href="http://www.habicurious.com/?p=3692">this</a>, and <a href="http://playborhood.com/2009/08/a_happy_hour_in_the_neighborhood-2/">this</a>. Everybody's is different — some are more involved than others; some are monthly not weekly; some have even have a theme.</p><p>As the days get shorter as we head into Autumn, it is still warm enough in California to continue for a bit, but probably not a good time to <em>start</em> something like this up in other areas where it's getting colder outdoors. Of course there's always indoors, but that involves a bit more preparation and logistics. (Especially if you don't know your neighbors that well at first, it's probably easier to spend some time outdoors before you open up your house to them!) I'm not sure if we'll be able to continue quite as before now that it's getting colder, darker, and wetter.  But it's been a great summer, and we have many more friends who happen to live right near me than we did before.</p><p>If you live in a place where you wouldn't mind getting to know your neighborhood a bit better, maybe this is something you might consider starting up when the weather permits it.</p><p><br /></p><p>(Photo CC from Flickr by <a href="http://flic.kr/p/8Az2Ef">ozmafan</a>)</p></div>

While we were a bit worried, it doesn't feel like it cannabilized the sales we would be making on our own store. The App Store is just another discovery mechanism and distribution mechanism, existing in addition to our own website and <a href="https://secure.karelia.com/buy_now/">online store</a>.</p><p>While I think the App Store is a great way to succeed, I don't agree with the decisions that a few of my fellow indie developers have made to <em>stop</em> offering their product on their own website and switch to the App Store exclusively.</p><p>In today's world, I think the best idea is to have your app available in <em>both</em> distributions. (<a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2012/08/24/releasing-outside-the-app-store/">Matt Gemmell offers some suggestions on that.</a>)</p><p>Now let's hope that the App Store team will do something about these worsening review queue times. (It's not the actual review that takes a long time, but <em>waiting</em> to get reviewed.) Our latest update had us waiting <em>a month</em>, and it looks from <a href="http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com/">submitted statistics</a> and <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2011430/developers-stymied-by-mac-app-store-approval-delays.html">reports from others</a> that it's affecting other developers as well.</p><p>These delays really cut into developers' schedules, and force some tough decisions. Whether to anticipate sitting on a new version for a month. Or to decide to let your self-released edition be kept up-to-date, letting the App Store version lag seriously behind. I suppose that's OK for minor updates, but what about if you have a major new update? If you want to send out press releases and garner publicity for a new version, it doesn't make sense to announce that it's available in one edition and a month away in another edition.</p><p>If only Apple Inc. had a little bit of extra cash, so that they could afford to hire a few more people on the App Store review team, to bring that review delay down to a week or less, as it was earlier this year!</p><p>Today's question for the comments: <em>What can Apple do to improve the Mac App Store experience for its developers?</em></p></div>

										</div><p>For the past five years or so, we had been mostly using PayPal to collect payments from our customers. But I was never really happy with it being our primary way of processing credit cards. Yes, I've heard some horror stories about merchants' accounts being frozen, but my main issue was that it just felt slightly second-class. If I see a website that only accepts PayPal, it doesn't feel as much like a "real business" as one that processes the credit card themselves. Plus, I know there are a lot of potential customers who hate PayPal, or maybe it just doesn't work in the country where they live.</p><p>A couple of years ago, I looked into getting a full-fledged merchant account and setting up a shopping cart gateway, but it was absolutely daunting. Just understanding all of the pieces we'd have to get working, and the compliance hoops we would have to jump through was overwhelming, so I didn't make it far into my research.</p><p>I'd heard great things about <a href="http://www.fastspring.com/">FastSpring</a> from fellow indie Mac developers, and we did actually use them as an alternate processor for a while, but I just wasn't that thrilled. They didn't integrate into our customer database system very well, and, like other similar processors, they function by <em>taking users away from your site and onto their site</em>. I don't like the idea of not having control over customers' experience or not being able to even measure how successful the interaction is, because buyers would be going off-site. Plus, it's hard to make the payment processor's site appear seamless to the user — it's usually obvious that they are going to another website.</p><p>So when I heard about Stripe, I was thrilled. Finally, a way to process credit cards that lets us control the experience on our <em>own site</em>, but also easy to implement.</p><p>Here are some aspects of Stripe that I like:</p><ul><li>It feels "native" to the customer. They stay on our website.</li><li>It's much easier to implement than PayPal (with its crazy IPN and PDT notifications) or full-fledged payment gateways.</li><li>The company and their website are very developer-centric. The <a href="https://stripe.com/docs">documentation</a> has examples in PHP, Curl, Ruby, Python, and Java! In fact, the documentation is "live," so that if you are logged in, the example code is hooked up to <em>your</em> test-data API keys, so you can just try it out right away.</li><li>Technical support is just amazing. I had a bunch of newbie questions that were answered quickly and helpfully.</li><li>Reasonable fees, close to PayPal, and way less than the full-service providers like FastSpring and eSellerate. (<a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/08/06/stripe-and-ab-testing-made-me-a-small-fortune/">Here's a great argument against obsessing over a couple of percentage points</a>).</li><li>Extremely easy to try things out in a test mode before switching to live data. Much easier than PayPal's "sandbox" system.</li><li>Web Hooks: Our server can get pinged when something happens. We have a script send us an email at the end of each business day when the day's charges have been calculated and a transfer to our bank account is queued up; the script also gets pinged if there is a chargeback on somebody's card — very rarely since we've switched to Stripe, BTW — so our system can automatically send the person an email to try and resolve the issue.</li><li>Refunds can be done with an API, so we've hooked that up to our back-end application we use for looking up licenses.  It's much easier than looking up somebody's transaction in our system, and <em>then</em> logging into PayPal to process the refund!</li></ul><p>Don't get me wrong; Stripe isn't perfect (yet). Here are a few drawbacks:</p><ul><li>Stripe is only set up for US- and Canada-based businesses. They are slowly expanding into other countries, however. This isn't a big deal since we're US-based, but it might not be an option if your business is set up elsewhere in the world.</li><li>They only accept US (and maybe now Canadian?) dollars. We would prefer to offer our product in the customer's <em>native currency</em> so they don't have to think about currency exchange.</li><li>Funds collected are held, and not deposited into your bank account, for 7 days. With PayPal, theoretically you could get your money out of PayPal and into your bank in just a few business days.  (Then again, some processors make you wait a whole month to get your money. So seven days isn't really a big deal.)</li><li>JavaScript is required for the processing to work. Then again, so what. PayPal requires JavaScript too.</li><li>Credit Card Security Codes (that three- or four-digit code you have to enter in a lot of forms) <a href="https://answers.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-void-a-charge-if-the-cvc-check-fails">aren't really checked adequately</a> using the current APIs. Hopefully they'll improve the APIs so we can require the code to match before letting a charge through.</li></ul><p>These are not major issues, though — at least for us. So we're using Stripe now.</p><p>We are <em>also</em> continuing to use PayPal, in parallel, as an alternate method of payment. What have we got to lose by continuing to support PayPal? It seems that a decent chunk of our customers prefer to use PayPal. I can see how people who know and like PayPal would choose to pay that way.  If <em>you</em> were familiar with PayPal, and you were buying something from a company you've just learned about, would you trust your credit card to them, or use PayPal for the 20th time?</p><p><strong>How Stripe Payment Processing Works</strong></p><p>For those who are technically inclined, here is how Stripe manages to function while the visitor stays on your website.</p><p>You build a web form with regular &lt;input&gt; elements, but you <em>don't</em> give the elements <em>name</em> attributes, which would normally cause the credit card information to be sent to your server — something you <em>don't want</em> to happen. Instead, you hook up your submit button to a bit of JavaScript. This script grabs the credit card information, and sends that over to Stripe's secure servers. Stripe returns a string token, which your script inserts into your form as a hidden element.</p><p>Then, the form — without any credit card number, but <em>with </em>the hidden Stripe token, gets submitted to your server. Your back-end script then asks Stripe to charge the card represented by that token; then it does whatever it needs to process your payment. (In our case, it generates a license to <a href="http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/" target="_blank">Sandvox</a>.)</p><p><strong>Control over User Experience</strong></p><p>When I started this project, I realized that for the first time, I could control what the payment form looked like and how it behaved! I spent a lot of time working on what I felt would be a great experience. But that's a topic for another post.</p><p><strong>Is Stripe for you?</strong></p><p>I think that there are a few different kinds of Mac indie developers. Those who don't want to have to deal with customer databases and payment processing might as well just use the Mac App Store as the distribution mechanism. Then there are the people who want to be able to sell directly to customers, but want a full-service company to handle the processing issues. FastSpring is great for that. But if you want more control over your purchasing experience, and you can set up some scripts on your server to manage license generation and charge cards, then Stripe is a great way to go. (And also, possibly, PayPal for those prefer that option.)</p><p>Have any of you tried out Stripe?</p><p><br /></p>

									<div class="article-summary"><p>For years, we've followed Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/Articles/StringsFiles.html">documented recommendation</a> that .strings files should be saved in UTF-16 format:</p>
										
										<div class="first blockquote-container wide center">
											<div style="" class="graphic"><blockquote class="figure-content">
													<p>Note: It is recommended that you save strings files using the UTF-16 encoding, which is the default encoding for standard strings files. It is possible to create strings files using other property-list formats, including binary property-list formats and XML formats that use the UTF-8 encoding, but doing so is not recommended. For more information about Unicode and its text encodings, go to <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">http://www.unicode.org/</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode</a>.</p>
													
												</blockquote>
											</div>
										</div><p>But this has caused so many headaches, that I finally decided it's time to defy this recommendation, and go UTF-8 for our .strings files.</p><p>UTF-8 is a file format that is consistent across all machines and byte-order architectures.  There is never any ambiguity.  It also works pretty well for file comparisons, especially when most of the characters are in the Roman alphabet. Yeah, maybe it's not as efficient at storing double-byte languages, but that's not really a big concern.</p><p>UTF-16, on the other hand, has turned into a big nightmare for us. We get localizations from people around the world (some using old PowerPC machines, some using Intel machines). It's never clear whether we are going to get:</p><ul><li>Little-endian, without the Byte Order Marker (BOM), a.k.a. UTF-16LE</li><li>Big-endian, without the BOM, a.k.a UTF-16BE</li><li>Little-endian, with <em>FF FE</em> BOM, a.k.a. UTF-16 sometimes</li><li>Big-endian, with <em>FE FF</em> BOM, a.k.a. UTF-16 othertimes.</li></ul><span data-img-src="../_Media/screen-shot-2012-10-05-at_med.png" data-img-src-hr="../_Media/screen-shot-2012-10-05-at_252.png" data-alt="Screen Shot 2012-10-05 at 5.07.53 PM" data-width="173" data-height="66" style="width:173px; height:66px;" class="not-first-item narrow right graphic-container">

										</span><p>It's amazing how many times I've gotten an update from a localizer, and when I try to merge it into our source base, it looks like everthing has changed. Opening the file with <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> (the best text editor I've found for dealing with character encoding issues), I often find that the looks like dense bunch of oriental characters. (The Japanese call this <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake">mojibake</a>.</em>) Then I have to fiddle with the encoding for a bit until it's a consistent, um, little-endian UTF-16. After re-saving, I can finally find out if any contents of the file really were changed.</p><p><strong>No more!</strong> I've converted every .strings file to UTF-8! Everything seems to work even though I have dared to stand up to the forces of UTF-16.</p><p>The crazy thing is, I had to write my own little Cocoa tool to convert the strings files to UTF-8. I call it "UTF8ifier".  Apple's built-in utility, <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a>, has never been particularly useful. My utility, on the other hand, uses +[NSString stringWithContentsOfFile: usedEncoding: error:] for reading, and if the encoding wasn't already UTF-8, then it writes it back out. </p><p>Have I committed a cardinal sin here by using UTF-8?  Or is this something that other developers have done? Any interest in making UTF8ifier public?</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; background-color: rgb(247, 251, 0); ">Update:</span> </strong>@bwebster commented on Twitter that Xcode now converts strings files to UTF-16 in the built product, so that means I shouldn't have to worry about manipulating and storing them in my source tree as UTF-8. Another good reason to use UTF-8 in source files is that GitHub can actually show differences. (If they are UTF-16, it treats the files like binary blobs!)</p><p>There's one more hoop I realized I have to jump through. When we build an archive, we run <em>genstrings</em>, which sadly has no option for output in UTF-8. So I think I need to add in a line to all of our projects, after the genstrings — as <a href="http://www.stevestreeting.com/2010/05/18/os-x-localisation-incremental-genstrings-and-utf-8-files/">these</a> <a href="http://fi.am/entry/keeping-your-localizablestrings-in-utf-8/">guys</a> do — to convert the UTF-16 to UTF-8, so that only legitimate changes get checked back into our source tree.</p><p>I guess I should file a Radar, requesting <em>genstrings</em> to be ablet to output in UTF-8. </p><p><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; background-color: rgb(247, 251, 0); ">Update 2:</span> </strong>@cocoanetics and @0xced suggested <a href="https://github.com/Cocoanetics/DTLocalizableStringScanner">DTLocalizableStringScanner</a>, which has re-built genstrings as open-source.  I've added a "-utf8" output option <a href="https://github.com/karelia/DTLocalizableStringScanner">in a branch</a>.</p>

That means that a lot of domanant email providers are going to have to come on-board.  That might happen.
