															<div class="article-summary"><p>I’ve been going to the <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire</a> on and off over the years since it first started in 2006. The original one in San Mateo is spectacular, but it has gotten so big and crowded in the past few years that it’s just not as enjoyable to me anymore as it was before it got super-crowded.</p><p>But the <a href="https://ebmakerfaire.wordpress.com/">East Bay Mini Maker Faire</a>, which just happened last weekend? Just the right size. Community-sized, and if you live in the area, there’s a good chance you will run into more than one maker or attendee that you know.</p><p>At last weekend’s event, I got to wear a “Maker” badge for the first time. I was helping the <a href="http://alamedabees.org/">Alameda County Beekeepers Association</a>, showing off a demonstration hive to visitors, answering questions, giving advice, and occasionally selling a jar of <a href="http://sweethomealameda.com/">honey that came from my bees</a> or from one of the other booth volunteer’s beehives.</p><p>Is being a beekeeper really being a “maker” in the strictest sense of the word? Sometimes I would ask children at the booth just <em>who</em> were the makers at our booth, and they would invariably point to the bees. So, tongue in cheek, I covered up the “M” on my badge and hand-drew the letter “T” so it read TAKER.</p><p>Even if I’m merely taking care of the bees and collecting their excess honey from time to time, it’s an activity that I enjoy becuase it’s doing something in the real world, not the virtual world of websites and programming. It’s a nice occasional break from my “day job” to check on the hives, collect honey, rescue a springtime swarm, and so forth.</p><img src="_Media/bee-emerging-from-cell_med_hr.jpeg" alt="bee emerging from cell" width="206" height="310" class="first narrow right graphic-container" />
																<p>Truly the best part of my experience at the beekeeper’s booth this last weekend was talking to the kids who came up to see what was going on. They all had lots of questions, and many of them were starting from a good foundation of knowledge. (Are you having problems with hives dying out? Is the queen here in this hive? etc.)</p><p>Every kid — and just about every adult — who saw what I pointed out in the demonstration hive was excited and fascinated. The frames that could be seen thorugh the plexiglass were covered with brood (egg) cells, and throughout the day, it was pretty easy to notice a few “new bees” starting to hatch out of their cells. Maybe you could just barely see the antennae wingling out from a chewed-open hole in the cell, or maybe the bee had gotten its entire head out and was slowly emerging. </p><p style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://flic.kr/p/8je59t">Photo CC</a></p><p style="text-align: left;">If you live near a Maker Faire — one of the main ones or a “mini” maker faire, I can’t recommend strongly enough that you check one out. <a href="http://makerfaire.com/map/">They are happening all over the world.</a></p><p style="text-align: left;"><br /></p>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>Recently, bicycling and pedestrian advocates in the town where I live have been managing to make a bit of headway in an otherwise car-centric culture that’s typical of almost all U.S. cities.</p><p>After being ignored, and then laughed at, we’re now at the stage — if you recall the Gandhi quote — where the opponents to safe streets are fighting back. They want to make sure that our Central avenue, currently an uncrowded four-lane road, stays that way (even though the speed limit is 25 MPH).  Ironically, I think it’s the same people that are against providing for other forms of transportation who also complain about too much traffic (by <em>other</em> drivers, of course).</p>
																<p>Our local advocacy group <a href="http://www.bikewalkalameda.org/">BikeWalkAlameda</a> started a petition — both an online petition and the old-fashioned type — to show that there is support for safer streets for people of all ages.</p>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>Last week I was down in Southern California, and I was astonished to see lush, green lawns all around me, at least in the town of Pasadena where I spent most of my time.</p><p>Considering that we are in the middle of a record-shattering drought in California, I couldn’t believe my eyes.</p><p>So with a bit of image-searching in Flickr, my own iPhone pictures, and some inspired snark, I put together two hypothetical “public service announcements” that I wished would exist, to get people to realize how destructive and wasteful it is to be watering your lawns this year.</p>

																</div><p>But a few days ago, I happened to read <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17331349-think-like-a-freak">Think Like a Freak</a></em>, the third in the <em>Freakonomics</em> book series by Levitt &amp; Dubner. And I came upon a story that explained how public service messages just like this one, which draw attention to the behavior you want people to avoid, actually ends up <em>increasing </em> the bad behavior.</p><p>They discuss a <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/pdf/cialdini.pdf">study by Robert Cialdini</a> where they found that the signs <span style="font-size: 1em;">in Arizona’s Petrified Forest National Park asking people not to steal pieces of petrified wood actually </span><em style="font-size: 1em;">increased </em><span style="font-size: 1em;">their theft.</span></p>

																			<p>Your heritage is being vandalized every day by theft losses of petrified wood of 14 tons a year, mostly a small piece at a time.</p>

																</div><p>So I guess that means that pointing out to Californians how they are wasting water is just making it worse. So we need to come up with something that actually works.</p><p>But still, it’s fun to dish out the snark, isn’t it?</p>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>At last week’s <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/yosemite">Yosemite</a> conference, Michael Lopp closed out the sessions with an inspiring talk about writing.</p>
																
																<div class="first wide center">
																	<div style="" class="graphic">
																		<div class="figure-content HTMLElement">
																			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Thanks for unblocking the writer in me <a href="https://twitter.com/rands">@rands</a> - what a perfect way to end <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cocoaconf?src=hash">#cocoaconf</a> at Yosemite! <a href="http://t.co/sqR5JAbdVo">pic.twitter.com/sqR5JAbdVo</a></p>&mdash; Gautam Godse (@gautamgodse) <a href="https://twitter.com/gautamgodse/status/591331377531850755">April 23, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

																	</div>
																</div><p>One of his three suggestions for <em>what</em> to write about was to rant about something. (The other two, IIRC, were to clearly explain something you know and to express an opinion.)</p><p>Ranting is great. It's sure to get the creative juices flowing as your blood boils over thinking about the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/10/8181531/cia-tagets-apple-xcode-encryption">CIA hijacking Xcode</a> or the state of the health care system in the US or the continued hazards in <a href="http://fukushimaupdate.com/">Fukushima</a> or the wasteful water management practices of California agribusiness in the face of our crisis-level drought.  And if you can write about these things, and spread understanding of knowledge that might improve the situation, that’s great. If we didn’t have people writing, blogging, tweeting, talking about these issues, they’d just be swept under the rug. (In fact, many important issues still are largely ignored by the public.)</p><p>But often ranting (usually on social media, not so much in long-form writing) ends up just complaining and spreading negativity.  Like that crying baby in the airplane a few seats back, or having to wait for the dishwasher repair dude too long, or the bad service you got at the restaurant.</p><p>To me, all that seems to do is to amplify the negativity for yourself, and spread negativity to others. </p><p>To me it seems like the people who complain a lot are the ones who seem to always have these things happen to them. They guy who rants about babies crying in the movie theatre?  It seems to happen to him a <em>lot</em>. It’s like the complaining attracts more negativity.</p><p>At Yosemite, one of the presentations — I think it was the one by <a href="https://twitter.com/jaimeejaimee">Jamiee Newberry</a>, who talked about her “<a href="http://www.jaimeejaimee.com/31days31people/">31 days 31 people</a>” project of expressing gratitude — reminded us to focus on what’s good, and be grateful as a way to be happier.</p><p>So I’m personally going to modify Lopp’s<span style="font-size: 1em;"> advice to rant, and come up with a type of rant that</span>’<span style="font-size: 1em;">s not negative! How about ranting with gratitude?</span></p><p>I’m considering some grateful rants to post in the days or weeks ahead. Stay tuned.</p>

																</div><p><br /></p><p>The conference wasn’t a technical conference at all.  And yet I think I learned exactly what I needed to learn, both from the presentations and in between them. (And I’m not just talking about 10-minute bathroom breaks.  There was a break between the morning sessions and the evening sessions where groups of us might go for an easygoing interpretive or photographic walk about the valley floor, or a vigorous climb up the <a href="http://www.yosemitehikes.com/yosemite-valley/mist-trail/mist-trail.htm">Mist Trail</a> to Vernal Falls.)</p><p>The talks at the conference were entertaining and profound. And while the presentations were conceived and delivered independently, the theme connections between talks were so strong that it felt like they were part of a planned network.</p><p>The presentation by <a href="https://twitter.com/antichrista">Christa Mrgan</a> blew me away because it had elements of Yosemite, iOS design, and personal perspective all rolled into one.  She walked us through the design of a hypothetical iPhone app about the gorgeous <a href="http://www.yosemitepark.com/high-sierra-camps.aspx">High Sierra Camps</a>, where she used to work for several summers. (I think that by the end of the talk, we all wanted that app to exist, and we all wanted to <em>be</em> at the hike-in accomodations that she described.  Maybe the next CocoaConf Yosemite could be somewhere accessible only by hiking in, with equipment packed in via mule?)</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ihnatko">Andy Ihnatko</a> (I’m imagining that the “H” in his last name might indicate aspiration — a puff of air, when pronounced, extrapolating from what we learned from <a href="https://twitter.com/savinola">Laura Savino</a>) told us what he <em>really</em> thinks about the ten-thousand-dollar Apple Watch; his perspective  on the importance of <em>not</em> being constantly bombarded by information and distraction was echoed in many other talks as well.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jamesdempsey">James Dempsey</a> (<a href="http://www.billboard.com/artist/6297050/james-dempsey-and-the-breakpoints/chart">Billboard-charting artist</a>), surrounded by several breakpoints and conditional breakpoints (who played guitar and sang excellently), rocked the house with his über-geeky songs. I wish I had brought my guitar so I could jam along (though I could never hold a candle to the guitar skillz of <a href="https://twitter.com/jdalrymple">Jim</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/brentsimmons">Brent</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dwiskus">Dave</a>.)</p><p>That’s just a small sampling of the wonderful presentations. Oh, and <a href="https://twitter.com/rands">Michael Lopp</a> inspired us all to start — or restart — writing. The result is manifested here; let’s see if I can keep it up.  Oh, thanks for the <a href="http://www.zebrapen.com/product-category/brand/brand-sarasa/?filter_point-size=115">awesome pen</a>.</p><p>All in all, the Yosemite conference was inspiring and amazing, both inside the building and outside of it. My thanks to the Klein family for organizing the event, the many speakers who were either old friends or, hopefully, will become new friends, and the many attendees I got to know (especially by following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_(conference)">C4</a> habit of sitting at a table with people you don’t yet know).  I raise my glass in a toast!</p>

																</div><p>If Apple Mail detects a giant attachment, it will offer to send it via Mail Drop, which means that the file is uploaded separately to a temporary iCloud URL.  It will stick around for 30 days.</p><p>The problem is that if you use this technique, it’s possible that any actual <strong>textual</strong> message might not be seen by the receiver of the email message.</p><p>If you send your email message as plain text — you might not even realize that you are sending a plain text message or a rich text message —or if the receiver’s email client shows them plain text instead of rich text — then ONLY the Mail Drop URL will be seen by the receiver.  Not your important message.</p><p>Here’s an example message I might compose.  (I use a monospaced font to display plain-text messages, but if you use a proportional font, it might be that obvious.)</p>

Here’s an excerpt of a rich text message’s raw source — note the text/plain segment containing only the URL.</p>

																</div><p>These years have taken an especially hard toll on my mother, who could no longer care for him at home.  But even with my father at a care facility, she still had many duties to perform, while spending an unbelievable amount of money.  When <em>Dilbert</em>’s Scott Adams published his <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/i_hope_my_father_dies_soon/">essay</a> “I Hope My Father Dies Soon,” it certainly struck a nerve.</p><p>When I would visit him, at first he was mostly “there,” mentally. He even achieved some fame within the facility and made the <a href="http://gooddaysacramento.cbslocal.com/video/8979655-sensational-senior-ken-wood/">local TV news</a> with a feature on him, due to his talent at drawing amazing portraits of his fellow residents. (Somehow his shaking hands would calm down when he was drawing.)  But then he deteriorated more, mentally and physically. When I would see him, there would be some of the man I remember, but not much. And less each time. So over those months, I found myself saying goodbye to him, at least in my own heart. He was shrinking, reverting, losing memories and physical abilities.</p><p>Then, late last week, he took a major turn for the worse, and never woke up.  And I’m very sad that he’s gone, but it’s also a blessed relief that it is over.</p><p>I try not to think of the recent months where his body, even his face barely resembled its former self. Instead I try to think of the hero that my father was, and replenish my mind with memories of before the Parkinson’s.</p>

As long as I can remember he had been drawing, mostly cartoon-style.  He would apply that talent to drawings he’d give as gifts to the kids, or make into personal greeting cards for friends, or wherever something graphical was needed, or in support of his work. He’d create advertisements for the local country newspaper and community events.</p>

																</div><p>When I was about 10, he started creating some children’s books. “The Pickle Machine”, “Exactly Like Me”, and “Jeremy Dingle” never were published — he tried but didn’t get any bites from publishers — but they delighted us and have delighted my kids as well.</p><p>Another example of how the Parkinson’s took hold was related to one of his children’s books. I had made a color copy of “The Pickle Machine” for my nephew so that he could enjoy it too. But for reasons unknown, my dad decided to rework the story, and had grand plans for changing the story. Though he wasn’t able to draw much, he would obsessively redo parts of the story, having whoever was near him help him cut drawings out, re-write the text, and rearrange sections.  And yet nothing of what he was doing made any sense. It got to a point of mania. Finally, in a moment of clarity, he consented to putting the entire project away on a high closet shelf. </p><p>Fortunately, the original, unaltered version still rests in my house. I have no desire to keep, or even see again, the Parkinson’s remix.</p><p><br /></p>

I remember being driven around in our family’s blue VW van while my parents looked for a place to live and start a new life. Finally we found an 18-acre property in the Sierra Nevada foothills, completely undeveloped, and decided to stay.</p>

And while it was never quite finished – we moved in way before there where amenities such as wallboard or plumbing or electrical outlets — I lived in the house my dad built until I moved away for college.</p><p> Though my dad was weakened terribly in his last years — it seemed like the Parkinson’s aged him by more than a decade within the span of a year or two — most of my memories of him were being incredibly strong. He had to be, as a forty-something-year-old homesteader. Carrying two five-gallon buckets of water uphill from a nearby stream, building barns and temporary quarters and then our house, hauling 10-gallon milk cans, my mother proudly called him the “homestead gorilla.” </p>

																</div><p><br /></p><p>Ken never had a single career track — the farming never really made a decent living for us — but overall I’d say that his biggest strength was sales. Selling hi-fi’s and stereos, then after moving on from the farming, he’d done well with selling advertising, solar water heaters, encyclopedias (along with my mom in that venture), and so on.  A skill that I never could quite grasp, yet he excelled at it and thrived at it.</p><p>His biggest love — besides his family — was music, though. His classical record collection — on LP and reel-to-reel tape; later on CD — was enormous. He enjoyed very little in the popular music genre, though he did have a weak spot for the lead singer of the Stone Ponies, Linda Ronstadt (who, as it turns out, is now afflicted with Parkinson’s). While he tolerated the music that his kids listened to growing up, it was Beethoven and Mozart and Schubert and Chopin on the stereo in my house growing up. And opera, which I never really could appreciate the way I eventually started appreciating orchestral music.</p><p>In his last year or so, he had a small stereo and a modest collection of his favorite music with him at the “old folks’ home.” I’m glad he had his music to keep him company, though I don’t think he was really able to make use of the equipment for the last few months.</p><p>Ken didn’t just listen to music during his lifetime. He was a singer — a tenor — who sang every chance he got. Growing up, I remember going to see him solo in Handel’s Messiah every year. While I never picked up a love for opera, I relish my memory of seeing him perform in Sacramento in the chorus there shortly before his diagnosis.  I have a cassette tape — I ought to digitize it — of some of his favorite classical songs that he’d sing.  (Schubert’s “Was ist Sylvia” for example, or his parody of “Granada” called “Granola”, a tribute to the crunchy cereal.)</p><p>Parkinson’s took away his singing and speaking voice, gradually, though sometimes there were little reprieves. I wasn’t there, but a couple of years ago, there was a memorial service for a friend, at a time when the disease had taken away most of his voice, where he found himself singing, full-strength, a song in tribute at the memorial.  For those who knew him there, it seemed like a small miracle. I wish I had been there for that.</p><p>I also remember him acting — a talent that completely skipped my generation. But he loved performing in community theatre, and also created a one-man show that he would perform week after week at a local campground resort, where he would play the famed stagecoach robber Black Bart.</p>

																</div><p><br /></p><p>Last year, my mom found an old reel-to-reel tape that was labeled somewhat cryptically along the lines of “Baby Announcement.” Intrigued, but with no machine to play it on, I took it home. Some research found a service that would convert a reel-to-reel tape into MP3 audio. Taking a gamble, I ordered a digitized recording. What came back (over a file download) was a treasure. When I was born — I’m the oldest — my dad had come home from the hospital, fired up his tape recorder, and called the relatives to announce my arrival. Hearing his speaking voice at its full strength — he was younger than I am now, actually — was amazing. I could also make out the voices of my grandmothers through the phone. Later in the tape, interspersed with odd recordings of music and television, so I’m glad I kept at it — I found other recordings from my own early childhood that he made while he was watching me. Amazing. What a great vault of memories from my life, from a time when I was too young to remember myself.</p>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>I've mentioned here <a href="honey-harvest.html" target="_blank">before</a> that I have some beehives. (Here's a <a href="http://www.gardeners.com/backyard-beekeeping/8529,default,pg.html?SC=XNET9014">nice article about hobby beekeeping</a> in case you are interested.) My two hives that I had last year didn't make it through the winter, so I had to start anew this year.  I caught three swarms this spring; the first one I caught has been doing just amazingly well. After just three months, I was already able to harvest some of their honey reserves.</p><p>Just before leaving for vacation last month I noticed that they had two full "supers" (boxes containing 10 frames) were full of honey. So I gave them some more layers in their hive, so they had a place to put even more honey, then took off to Europe.</p><p>Now that I'm back, I finally had a chance this weekend to go harvest those extra frames.  Four of the frames weren't quite ready yet (the honey cells should be capped up with wax when the honey is ready to go), so I left them in the hive. That left me sixteen frames — about 3 times the small harvest I had last year.</p><p>Yesterday, I put Fleetwood Mac on "shuffle" on the iPod and got busy in the kitchen to get this honey out of those frames.</p><p>Just for fun, and since it's easier to use the iPhone camera in the kitchen than it is when I'm out in my badass beekeeping suit with the bees, I thought I'd take some pictures to show how the honey is extracted from the frames that come from the hive.</p><p>Here's a "super" with most of the frames still in it. I'd already shooed the bees away, so I've brought this into my kitchen where fortunately I have a very large, easy-to-clean counter.</p>

																</div><p>You can see, toward the top of the photo, the exposed side of one of the frames.  Each one of these frames holds about 3 pounds of honey. But it's trapped in there; each cell is capped with beeswax.</p><p>Using a special tool, I scrape the top layer of beeswax off. (This is the messiest part of the operation.) The scrapings (a mix of beeswax and honey) get saved for later.</p>

If you look carefully you'll see that the honey on the right edge (added later, I reckon) is a lighter color than the darker honey in the rest of the photo.</p><p>I dropped three frames, uncapped-side-out, into a hand-crank extractor (borrowed from another beekeeper) that uses centripetal force to throw the honey out to the sides, where it drips down the stainless steel walls to the bottom.</p>

																</div><p>By the time I got through the sixteen frames, that bucket was pretty full! If I had had any more to spin, I would have had to start a new bucket's worth!</p><p>The weird coloring is just little bits of beeswax that also got spun off of the frames.(I call it "oatmeal" because that's what it looks like to me.) It rises to the top, and can be filtered out or just scraped off the top after it has a chance to settle.</p>

																	</div>
																</div><p>The total amount of honey in that bucket, from those 16 frames? <strong>A bit over fifty pounds</strong>. Wow.</p><p>The next step is to jar it up. The bucket has a spigot on the bottom, just like the extractor, so it's easy to fill up jars. I slap on my homemade label (Handmade "Sweet Home Alameda" label designed to resemble the Lynyrd Skynyrd logo) and the jars are good to go!</p><p>(Go where? Well, so far my harvests have been small enough that it's just barely enough for the family and sharing with friends. This time, I may share with even more friends! I'm not quite ready to give up the software business yet….)</p>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>Today, none of my Karelia colleagues or I were able to get WWDC tickets.</p><p>I really agree with <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2013/04/25/end-wwdc/">Daniel Jalkut's analysis</a>, but I have some more thoughts.</p><p>The WWDC that I knew and love is gone. With only a tiny fraction of the people I know getting tickets, it means that WWDC will be a conference filled with strangers to me — and to each other.</p><p>Sure, there will be some parties, and maybe a chance to run into somebody you know, but the odds are against you.</p><p>Maybe the problem is that when Apple Started WWDC, it made sense to have the entire <em>world</em> invited. These days, there are too many Mac and iOS developers in the world.</p><p>Seeing that the talks are going to be made available online, it's really the labs and the socializing that we will all be missing. But do all those need to be concentrated in a single week, in a single place?</p><p>What if Apple made the sessions be online only, as Daniel suggestions, and come up with a series of regional conferences/labs around the world, based on developer population?</p><p>Actually, this kind of thing has happened before. The developer 'tech talks' a couple of years ago. They've also had a few special, small "developer kitchens" in Cupertino, though that was before the masses started growing.</p><p>Why not just start up an annual program of "tech talks" which are staffed by DTS engineers and evangelists, touring the world constantly? They could function as mobile versions of WWDC labs — but just as importantly, there could be social aspects to the gatherings, so that fellow developers had a chance to eat, drink, and be merry with fellow developers in their local area.</p></div>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>Yesterday, I ran across a product that you could install in your house to put in a convenient USB power plug (or two) into a wall outlet, going alongside the regular AC outlets (USA style).</p><p>After mentioning it on Twitter, I got a bunch of replies from my tweeps — and later, even a company representative from one of the available products.</p><p>I got recommendations for three different outlets:</p><ul><li><a href="http://fastmac.com/usocket.php">U-Socket</a>. Ports to the left of AC outlets. Standard (rounded) and décor (rectangle) styles.</li><li><a href="http://www.newertech.com/products/power2u.php">Power2U</a>. Closable ports on either side, in the center.</li><li><a href="http://www.leviton.com/OA_HTML/ProductDetail.jsp?partnumber=T5630-W&amp;section=42298&amp;minisite=10251">Leviton USB Charger</a>.

																			<!-- /sandvox.ImageElement --></div>
																	</div>
																</div><p>All three seem to have sufficient power for charging your iOS devices. U-Socket claims 2.4A charging power; Power2U says 2.0A; the Leviton says 2.1A.</p><p>The U-socket indicates that it won't drain power when it's not in use. The Power2U makes the same claim. I didn't find any similar claim about the Leviton. However the Leviton has a "smart chip which recognizes and optimizes the charging power of your device," so I'm curious how that compares to the others.</p><p>All outlets are 15 Amps for the AC power, though the Power2U promises a 20A version coming soon.</p><p>Each of these seems adequate, so it may come down to form factor if you are choosing the brand. Unfortunately, the place where I want to install one of these is on a double-wide (4-outlet) box, so my choices are limited. I may end up using a Leviton, since it doesn't require a custom wall plate, and I could put the Leviton and a standard décor outlet into the box and use a standard double-wide décor plate. Another alternative would be to carefully cut the holes needed in a stock cover from your local little-box hardware store, or use a 3-D printer if you are geekier than me!</p><p>Before making your choice, make sure that the outlets will fit in your electrical box! This has bitten some people, apparently!</p><p>An alternative, not requiring any rewiring, is this add-on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slim-Wall-Plate-Surge-Protector/dp/B0065KWUCK/">surge protector with USB ports</a>. It has 2.1 Amps for fast charging. It also provides three AC plugs. Nice!</p><p>One interesting issue came out of the discussion: Data privacy. If you install one of these in your own home, it wouldn't be a worry, but would you plugin your iPhone or iPad into such a device in a public place, where <em>conceivably</em> there could be a device hooked up to suck out your contacts. It is interesting how data and power are delivered on the same plug, so unless you have some sort of adapter or extension cable that you know only will let power (and not data) through, you would be putting your data at risk if you plugged your device into an untrusted port.</p><p><em>Thanks to @bbum, @jnouwen, @simX, @mjtsai, @bjh, @weldon, @ddribin, @siegel, @McCarron, @AbbiV from FastMac, and anybody else I missed here, for their advice!</em></p>

															<div class="article-summary"><img src="_Media/mail_filter_med.png" alt="mail filter" width="120" height="84" class="first narrow right graphic-container" /><p>I've long been a fan of the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>" way of life, especially when it comes to my email. I've managed to keep "Inbox Zero" fairly consistently for a few years now, and it's very liberating.</p><p>One aspect of email that has long bothered me, however, is how usually my inbox — well, really multiple inboxes; I have several email addresses — are usually filling up with messages that I don't want to read when I'm on the go. If I'm away from my desk, or taking a weekend or vacation away, I really don't need to see GitHub updates, bank updates, company newsletters, and so forth.</p><p>I had tried using mail rules in the past to filter some messages into specific email boxes, but then when I <em>am</em> at work, these filters just seem to get in the way.</p><p>I'm trying out a new system now that I wanted to share with both of my readers. It's still in progress, but so far it's working out nicely.</p><p>Here's how it works. I have a machine running Mail all the time, checking frequently and applying rules, twenty-four hours per day. The goal is to get as many non-essential messages out of the inbox as quickly as possible so that when I do check email, from wherever I am, the inbox contains only messages that I probably <em>do</em> want to see. Usually that means personal communications from people, where I may want to answer them even if I'm not at my desk.</p><p>I've created mailboxes for — and filters to fill — these four categories:</p><ul><li>Work, Daily</li><li>Work, Weekly</li><li>Personal, Daily</li><li>Personal, Weekly</li></ul><p>The filters are usually based on either matching a specific subject or sender. If you have a system of signing up for newsletters with special email addresses (e.g. including a "+" in the address) you might be able to match by that criteria. No matter the specifics, the goal of the rules will be to decide how important a message is in the context of work or personal emails.</p><p>If a message is something I probably should read soon <em>while I'm working</em>, it goes into "Work, Daily." That becomes, essentially, a secondary inbox while I'm at my desk. I'll check it several times a day when I'm working. But if I'm not at my desk, I won't be seeing these, since there isn't any point in them until I get back to my desk!</p><p>Examples of these in my case, as a software developer, include GitHub notifications, build script output, notifications of case assignments from Fogbugz, daily software promotional emails, notifications when somebody posts to a topic I'm subscribed to on our forum, payment notifications, and so forth. Critical notifications, such as server problems, should definitely <em>not</em> be put into this category; I want to hear about such matters even if I'm on the go, so I can do something about it, even if it means delegation.</p><p>Work-related emails that aren't time-sensitive at all can go into a "Work, Weekly" mailbox, for checking every few days (or once a week) <em>when the opportunity arises</em>. Newsletters from other companies, technical mailing lists, etc. might go into this category. Anything that I could easily miss for a few days should go here.  (On my mail rules for the "weekly" messages, I also have the messages marked as "read", so that they aren't beckoning me. Otherwise, I might be tempted to "whack-a-mole" and read the weekly messages prematurely, when I should be paying attention to other matters!)</p><p>I then have my personal daily/weekly rules that work along the same principles. "Daily" emails include daily news bulletins, bank/stock alerts, Netflix notifications, etc. — where I want to know about it that day, not several days later.  Messages that can wait a few days include bank statements, kickstarter updates, political updates, newsletters, and so forth.</p><p>So far, this has worked for me quite well. Since I'm just starting with this program, I'm often finding messages that slip through, so I need to tweak my filters from time to time. But after just a few days with this, I'm finding that my inbox barely has any messages in it, and it's easier to process my "daily" or "weekly" messages efficiently when I'm in the right context.</p><p><em>Want to give this a try?  Any tips or suggestions on improving this?  Please let me know in the comments.</em></p><p><br /></p></div>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>Last month, an article called <a href="http://dcurt.is/the-best">The Best</a> made its way around the Blogosphere. Not long after, a rebuttal called <a href="http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/the-worst/">The Worst</a> offered a different perspective.</p><p>I couldn't place my finger on why I didn't really agree with either point. OK, I probably veer toward the "I don't need the ultimate dinnerware" camp.</p><p>But one must live at either extreme, given a choice? How about something in the middle, where you don't feel the need to seek out the brand that will impress all your friends and readers of your blog, but something that will actually <em>last</em> for a while so you don't have to keep buying replacements?</p><p>For years, I would find that I would need to buy a new pair of slippers each year, with the previous year's purchase having completely fallen apart from wear and tear. (I have a home office — they get a <em>lot</em> of use!) That got really tiresome, so I looked into an alternative. I bought a somewhat more expensive pair of slippers from <a href="http://theleatherworks.net/">these guys</a>. That was three winters ago that I bought them, and guess what‽ They are in almost perfect condition today.</p><p>Last year, I bought slippers for the rest of the family. Of course, they are still kicking as well.</p><p>Next example: You know those cheap umbrellas you buy for $3-$5 when you are caught in the rain? Yeah, I've gone through a lot of those. They don't last long.</p><span data-img-src="_Media/umbrella_med.png" data-img-src-hr="_Media/umbrella_med_hr.png" data-alt="umbrella" data-width="125" data-height="108" style="width:125px; height:108px;" class="first narrow right graphic-container">
																	<noscript><img src="_Media/umbrella_med.png" alt="umbrella" width="125" height="108" /></noscript>
																</span><p>But I also have a really cool umbrella I got as a gift, featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Street;_Rainy_Day">Paris Street; Rainy Day</a> by Gustave Caillebotte. This was three or four years ago, maybe more. I walk in the rain a lot (when it's too wet to be on a bicycle) and this umbrella has seen a lot of use. And it's still in perfect condition.</p><p>(I'm guessing that <a href="http://www.artistgifts.com/la-salva-umbrellas/rainy-day-paris-umbrella7419.html">this</a> is the umbrella that I got, which has lasted so long. There are appear to be several variations available for sale over the web, but the one pictured here seems to match the tip and handle of mine.)</p><p>Point being, that <strong>sometimes it is worth a bit of extra cost if the item you buy is actually going to last for a while.</strong></p><p>In related news:</p><p>I was recently wondering what would happen if the couple in the Rainy Day painting had that same umbrella? This little hack made in <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> was the result.  My apologies to the heirs of Caillebotte.</p>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>Today I ran across an awesome blog post from earlier this year on web database security: "<a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/05/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know.html">Everything you ever wanted to know about building a secure password reset feature</a>."</p><p>Since reading online tales of some of the horrible things that crackers have been able to do to get to people's account information, I thought that this was a fascinating set of guidelines on building a database of users and passwords the right way.</p><p>The original article is worth a read, especially if you are working on any database of users, but it's a long read. Here is my brief summary for your convenience (and perhaps someday for my future reference):</p><ol><li>In your database, store passwords as a one-way hash with a salt that is also stored in the table.</li><li>Don't send the user's password to them.  (Doing the above will obviate that.)</li><li>If user requests a password reset, send an email regardless of whether that email is associated with an account.  (If it's not an account email, you can tell them that in the email, NOT on the web page.)</li><li>In the password reset mail, send a time-limited URL with a unique code that allows them to go in and set a new password; do NOT send a new password. (See point 2).</li><li>Consider using a CAPTCHA on a password reset form if automated attacks are an issue.</li><li>To avoid problems where somebody's email is compromised, a password reset might contain secret questions.  If you do this, make sure that they are concise, specific, diverse, hard to discover, and constant over time.</li><li>Secret answers should be stored encrypted in the database. (Hashes are problematic if they need to be verified by a person.)</li><li>Consider two-factor authentication.</li><li>Do not allow password reset via username, only email address</li><li>In your password reset emails, indicate the IP address of where the reset request came from.</li><li>Notify the account owner via email when account information is changed.</li><li>Do lots of logging (but without sensitive information) to help uncover malicious behavior.</li><li>Do not lock out the old password from working until the new password information is completely verified.</li></ol><p>All in all, a good overview. Hopefully more and more account providers follow this kind of advice — I cringe when I see my password sent to me over email in clear text!</p></div>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>Over the last few years, heeding warnings from Apple that we would need higher-resolution icons, we got into the habit of asking our icon guy to make double-size images (sometimes even quadruple-size) when we needed to create a graphic that was better created as a bitmap rather than a vector graphic.</p><p>So when the MacBookPro with Retina Display came out, we thought we were in pretty good shape.</p><p>Unfortunately, we had to throw out a lot of our work and backtrack. Seeing our icons on the actual retina display, we realized they needed to be a bit sharper, especially when it came to crisp details like lines and outlines.</p><p>What we had been doing was essentially doubling any single-pixel lines from the source image. So if we had an icon with a rectangle bordered by a single pixel, the double-size icon would have a retina bordered by a two-pixel-wide line.</p><p>So instead, we had the icons re-done so that the lines were a single pixel in the retina version. But to compensate for the fact that this might not be as bold as the original, we made the line a bit darker (or more opaque, which usually ends up being the same thing).</p><p>Take for example this icon in Sandvox's inspector: <img src="_Media/page_inspector-orig_med.png" alt="page inspector-orig" width="16" height="16" class="first" /> On the left is the image enlarged to match the new retina size; on the right is the retina image. (Both of these are enlarged so you can easily see the pixels.)</p>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>There's a great resource you should install on your Mac(s): a "hosts" file called "<a href="http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/">how to make the internet not suck (as much)</a>." This is a huge file that masks tons of nasty websites that you probably don't want to see any content from: shock-sites like GoatSe, user-tracking sites, nasty popups, known trojan/malware sites, adware sites like doubleclick.net, and so forth.</p><p>I don't want to see any content from any of these domains, and you probably don't either. Fortunately, Dan Pollock has created this mammoth file, which, if properly installed, will block these domains from being reached. And, he updates the file pretty frequently as new honorees are inducted into the hall of shame.</p><p>Here's a technique I came up with to install and update this file on your system. Once a week, it fetches a fresh update to the file and installs it on your system.</p><p>It does take a bit of command-line-fu, however.</p><p>First, you need to become root in the terminal.  Type this, and then enter your password when prompted:</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier; "><strong>sudo su -</strong></span></p><p>You should see a new prompt, something like this:</p><p><span style="font-family: Courier; background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; "><em>DansMac:~ root# </em></span></p><p>First, get a current copy of the file, by pasting this line:</p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier; "><strong>curl --silent http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts | grep '^127.0.0.1' &gt; /etc/hosts</strong></span></p><p>Now type this to edit your system's (not your user's) crontab file. These are the periodic tasks that your system will perform.</p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier; "><strong>crontab -e</strong></span></p><p>This will open up a terminal-based text editor. Maybe you have configured that to your editor of choice (*cough*vi*cough*) or you can stumble your way through whatever is offered as a default.</p><p>Paste in a line similar to this:</p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier; "><strong>10 10 * * 3 curl --silent http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts</strong></span><strong style="font-family: Courier; font-size: 14px; "> | grep '^127.0.0.1'</strong><strong style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Courier; font-size: 14px; "> &gt; /etc/hosts</strong></p><p>You can adjust the parameters before the <em>curl</em> command.  In this case, it's going to fetch a fresh copy at 10:10 on the third day of the week (Wednesday).</p><p>Close and save the crontab editor, and you should be set!</p><p>There you have it.  My Christmas* gift to you.</p><p><em>* If you don't celebrate Christmas, consider it a belated birthday gift! Next year I'll try to send you a card!</em></p><p><em><strong>Update: I've updated the command to only bring in lines that start with 127.0.0.1 so that it's impossible for this file, if somehow compromised, to do anything other than redirect a domain to your own machine.</strong></em></p></div>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>I just ran across a nice article, <a href="http://timharford.com/2010/07/why-we-still-love-board-games/">Why we still love board games</a>. Worth a quick read.</p><p>My family and I love board games. We have some cabinets that are overflowing with them, and for the most part we actually play them.</p><p>And when I say board games, I mean the actual physical games, not the computer versions of them. I mean, my pals at IconFactory and Coding Monkeys and those other places where they have made iOS versions have done what appears to be a really bang-up job on their adaptations of some of my favorite board games, but I have no interest in playing them, because a board game you can touch and spread out on your dining table is always going to be better.</p><p>The article I linked to mentions (and pictures) <em>Carcasonne</em>, <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, and <em>Ticket to Ride</em>.  All three of those are just wonderful. (I barely recognized the Settlers image, though — my copy is second-generation, from the mid-1990s, just after they started producing it in English, and the design has gone through a few changes!)</p><p>If you still think of games from forty or more years ago when you think of board games, you are missing out.</p><p>If you have small kids, I should point out that you can get kids started on some of these games much earlier than you'd think — for instance with Carcassone, we would just make a "junior" version of it by making the game be about filling out the land tiles, but <em>not</em> keeping score.</p><p>If you are giving Christmas gifts (OK, or other holiday gifts, though Christmas is the only holiday that's all about the gifts) then a board game is a great idea.  If your town or region has a local game store, go shop there — you'll get personal recommendations, a hand-picked selection, and a much warmer feeling than if you buy online or from a big box toy store.</p><p>Even if you've already bought an online version of one of these board games, do yourself a favor and try it out in physical form. Save the online version for when you are on a road trip and you couldn't bring the box.</p><p>Here are some of my favorites, off the top o' me head:</p><ul><li>Settlers of Catan — The modern classic.  Top of my list, and probably top of everybody else's list.</li><li>Stone Age — A recent discovery but we are constantly playing this game!

															<div class="article-summary"><p>A few days ago, my friend Colin and his wife Sara released a new iPhone app ("<a href="http://daringplan.com/">Selene — The ovulation-tracking tool for serious women</a>"). As a new application, it's going to start needing some attention from the press, from bloggers, etc. in order to make it a success.</p><p>And then yesterday, I was listening to the <a href="http://ideveloper.tv/blog/2012/11/ideveloperlive-episode-71/">latest podcast episode of iDeveloper Live</a>, in which Scotty and John interviewed Erica and Steve from <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/">TUAW</a> about their new eBook, <em>Pitch Perfect </em>[<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/pitch-perfect/id528277176?mt=11">iBooks</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083U5DTC">Amazon</a>]. Naturally, I thought about the challenge that my friends — and other new developers — have in getting their new apps noticed.</p>

(I did!)</p><p>Colin and Sara had no problem getting me to mention the app — seriously, it looks pretty cool even though I'm not exactly the target market for it — but hopefully for the bigger blogs, Colin and Sara will be able to take advantage of Erica's and Steve's advice and express their enthusiasm for their app that is equal to the level of enthusiasm and dedication that it took them to build their app.</p><p>(I should point out my old "<a href="http://www.karelia.com/mac_indie_marketing/">Mac Indie Marketing Blog</a>" here. I put it aside a while ago, before the Mac App Store became a reality, but I think that most of the ideas that I had gleaned and shared in that blog are still relevant, even in a post-Mac-App-Store world.)</p><p style="text-align: right; ">Photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tyman/3620101932/">Tyler Ball</a></p>

No, I'm not talking about the Presidential Election!  I'm talking (again) about Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>TUAW recently wrote about the <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/11/06/lessons-from-sandy-crashplan-and-the-importance-of-off-site-bac/">importance of off-site backup</a>. I wanted to chime in with my personal story.</p><p>Many years ago, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Firestorm_of_1991">large firestorm</a> that destroyed thousands of houses and apartments. And I was living within the evacuation zone. And in my home office was the <em>only copy</em> of some program code I had spent <em>years</em> working on.</p><p>I was actually quite religious about backing up my work! (In those days, we didn't have Apple's Time Machine. I backed up onto 44-Megabyte <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syquest">Syquest</a> cartridges.) The problem was that both the main computer <em>and</em> the backup were sitting on my desk.</p><p>"No worries," you may say.  "Just grab the disks on the way out the door — problem solved!" Except that I was actually away that day, so by the time the area was closed off, I couldn't get back to my house to grab anything precious.</p><p>That was the day that I became aware of the importance of off-site backups.</p><p>Fortunately, the fire was contained and I got lucky. But I still shudder to think of how much work would have been lost.</p><p>The moral of the story is that you, dear reader, really ought to get something set up for offsite backup. You probably have a whole lot of stuff that, if lost due to earthquake, house fire, hurricane, flood, robbery or other unfortunate event, would really bum you out.</p><p>The aforementioned TUAW article was big on CrashPlan. I've actually tried that but I wasn't impressed. It seemed like a non-Mac app trying to masquerade as a Mac app.  It was just klunky. Maybe it has improved, but I didn't like it back then.</p><p>The Internet-based service that I use and enjoy is <a href="http://www.backblaze.com/">BackBlaze</a>. It's inexpensive ($50/year), and it's well-integrated into Mac OS X. Once it's going, I usually don't have to think about it.</p><p>I highly recommend setting this up!  Think of it as insurance.  (However, if you are working with a <em>lot</em> of data, like video work, and you don't have a ultra-fast Internet connection, you may want to start out your backup by filling up a spare hard drive with your data and leaving it in the care of an out-of-town friend. It might take <em>weeks or months</em> to get your data finshed uploading to a remote backup service! It would be better if you were secured from the get-go.)</p><p>BackBlaze has saved my proverbial butt more than once, though not due to anything as dramatic as fire or flood. A few months ago, a hard drive failed on my main Mac.  I wasn't worried about my data, because I use Time Machine for local backup. (Also important!)  I was ready to just restore from my Time Machine drive, when I discovered that the backup had somehow gotten deactivated a while back. My Time Machine backup was way, way out of date.</p><p><strong>But my Backblaze backup was current! I ordered a hard drive filled with my data to be shipped to me, and I was completely back in business.</strong></p><p>So don't say I didn't warn you. Get your data backed up, offsite!</p><p style="text-align: right; ">(Photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/19942094@N00/8156668002/">Randy Le'Moine Photography</a>)</p></div>

That's because land-line phones run on their own (DC) power supply. So when AC power was out, the phone system still worked just fine.</p><p>These days, it's different. So many people have given up on having a land-line, in favor of going cellular only.  And I'm willing to bet that most people's land-line phones won't even work without AC power!  (I checked — we still have a phone extension that doesn't require AC, though our main cordless phone does.)</p>

And that can be bad news in a disaster, when the high-tech utilities we have come to rely upon are out of commission, even if temporarily.</p><p style="text-align: left; ">Telephony is just one of the utilities that we are losing our scaffolding for. Another essential technology that we're coming to rely on more and more is GPS. It's been called "the invisible utility." I recently watched this fascinating <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/todd_humphreys_how_to_fool_a_gps.html">TED talk about GPS</a>; I learned that it could be disrupted or spoofed pretty easily.  It's not a big deal if GPS goes out in your iPhone and prevents you from finding the nearest Wal-Bucks, but it is pretty scary if it goes out when, say, a ship is trying to navigate into a harbor on a foggy night. The problem is that the older technology (e.g. lighthouses, radar) is being phased out in favor of GPS.</p><p>Back to New York: I've seen <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/slideshow/224831">pictures of corner markets staying open</a>, albiet dark, while the power has been out. Small shopkeepers can probably keep things running pretty well, though maybe they have to resort to some manual techniques for handling cash and giving out change. It's probably hard to handle credit cards if they are used to AC power for doing so. So certainly, as a resident, having some low-tech greenbacks on-hand is a good idea just in case the high-tech alternative is unusable.</p><p>What I wonder about, though, is how to the big stores — supermarkets, especially — handle a disaster where there are hundreds of hungry or panicked residents, and no way for employees to take their money? The employees are probably not even trained for low-tech contingency plans. It's sad to think about — those worried customers are probably going to turn into a rioting mob if the store they are at is unable or unwilling to sell them what's on their shelves.</p><p><em>What are the other technologies where we are unwisely removing their lower-tech alternatives?</em></p>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>Listening to the <a href="http://ideveloper.tv/blog/2012/10/ideveloperlive-episode-70/">latest iDeveloper Live podcast</a> in super-fast mode (QuickTime Player 7 FTW!), John Fox brought up the idea of thanking people. Perhaps this came up because it's now November, month where Thanksgiving happens, but I thought that would be a great idea. So in this post, I'm going to thank a few people who have helped me in my professional life.  It is impossible, and it would be boring, to try to go through everybody in the world, so I've just picked out a few people that I thought of — mostly people from my earlier Cocoa days. (Maybe I'll do another round later.)</p><p>Thanks Ken Dyke, a co-worker of mine at Electronic Arts back in the mid-nineties. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/Apple-acquires-Next%2C-Jobs/2100-1001_3-256914.html">When Apple bought out Next</a>, I was perplexed — but Ken's over-the-top enthusiasm about the event sparked my interest and insatiable appetite in learning OpenStep (the predecessor of Cocoa). Without that spark, it might have been years before I started learning that technology.</p><p>Thanks Bertrand Mansion, who created the mailing list archives now called <a href="http://www.cocoabuilder.com/">CocoaBuilder</a>. Nowadays I'm just as likely to find a technical answer via a Google or <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> search, but back in the day, Bertrand's archives were the place to find just about anything related to Cocoa.</p><p>Thanks Dave Shea, creator of <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>, who showed me that it's possible to style in an infiite number of ways using CSS. This was, in many ways, the inspiration for Sandvox.</p><p>Thanks Robert MacKimmie, and the rest of the leaders of <a href="http://www.bang.org/">BaNG</a>, the Bay Area Next Group, which met regularly in the late nineties and early ohsies. I was new to all of this technology, and because of these meetings, I met a lot of Ex-NeXTers who inspired me to continue playing around with Apple's inchoate operating system. Incidentally, Robert was my <a href="http://citybees.com/">first introduction</a> to the then-astonishing idea of urban beekeeping, something I now practice myself. </p><p>Thanks Tom Negrino and Dori Smith, both individually and collectively. Tom had written a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1001443/watson.html">review of Watson for Macworld Magazine</a> which helped greatly with the program's success. Then one day I was in San Jose, crossing the street, when I recognized Tom by a name badge he was wearing, and we've been friends ever since. Dori has provided a lot of mentorship and inspiration to me in the fields of web design, javascript, and blogging.</p><p>Thanks Lowell Schneider, who helped me with some Cocoa mentoring during the days I was unemployed and writing Watson. I would camp out in his nearby <a href="http://schemaresearch.com/">Schema Research</a> office once or twice a week. I remember being blown away by some of his Interface Builder palettes (now, alas, something no longer possible in Xcode) that essentially made data binding possible before it became supported officially by Apple.</p><p>OK, that's all for now — no point in getting maudlin. :-)</p><p><em>Who do you have to thank for where you are now?</em></p></div>

															<div class="article-summary"><p>I'm relieved that we have finally been able to release <a href="http://www.sandvox.com/" target="_blank">Sandvox 2.7</a> today!</p><img src="_Media/l_22585_0177971_a093cc32_med.jpeg" alt="l 22585 0177971 a093cc32" width="300" height="429" class="first narrow right graphic-container" /><p>Behind the scenes, this has been a long time coming, thanks to what I like to call a "Perfect Storm" that Apple laid in our path. (The recent destruction by Hurricane Sandy is just a coincidence, really!)</p><p>Apple had a very busy summer, throwing down several gauntlets for us:</p><ul><li>Sandboxing required for the Mac App Store (as of June 1)</li><li>Retina Display Macs (released June 11)</li><li>MobileMe ending (as of June 30)</li><li>Mountain Lion (released July 25)</li></ul><p>So while we would have liked to to work on some new features independent of what Apple was doing, we found that these events from Apple were, well, opportunities for us to address.</p><p>MobileMe ending was the first challenge we tackled; we were able to create an iWeb site extractor and submit that to Apple as part of version 2.6, before the Sandboxing deadline. (We wanted to give iWeb users plenty of time to migrate their iWeb sites over to Sandvox before the MobileMe lights went dark.)</p><p>But then after June 1, we were only able to submit bug fixes to the App Store until we could get Sandvox working in the Sandbox. (And yes, imagine how often I mistype "sandbox".)</p><p>Getting our application Sandboxed was a bit of a challenge.  So while we had the other responses to Apple's actions implemented pretty quickly — Retina application graphics, new Mountain Lion features — it took weeks and weeks of refinement, submissions, rejections, and so forth — until our new sandboxed version 2.7 was finally approved yesterday.</p><p>I don't mind responding to Apple's developments, but four at a time was a bit much, thank you very much.</p><p>Now that we are past that, maybe we can start working on some new features that have nothing to do with what Apple is doing!</p><p><br /></p></div>
