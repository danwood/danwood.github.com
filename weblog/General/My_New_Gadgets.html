<h1>My New Gadgets</h1>


<p>
This Christmas and post-Christmas season, I got some cool gadgets.  I love 'em.
</p><p>
First off, I got one of those USB keychain-size hard drives.  I got it out of necessity &mdash; I was trying to transfer some files to a PC at an OfficeMax store.  Now that I have it, I'm seeing all kinds of cool uses for it.  At at a friend's house, he took some pictures of our kids.  Within a few minutes, he had moved this pictures to iPhoto on his PowerBook, and then to my little hard drive, so now I have those pictures too.  I've put some useful data (encrypted on a .dmg volume) on the thing so I have it with me.  Mine is 512MB though now there are one-giggers around.  And I didn't really pay attention the brand; I'm sure they are all roughly the same with different levels of aesthetics and price.

The next thing I got is the <a href="http://www.tvbgone.com/home.php">TV-B-Gone</a> universal remote control TV-turner-offer.  This is on my keychain too.  It's really cool... whenever you find yourself in a restaurant or waiting room or airport with an annoying TV, chances are, this thing can turn it off.  (But I wouldn't use it on a sports bar on SuperBowl Sunday, even though it would be tempting!)

Finally, I got the "Down Low Glow" from <a href="http://www.fossilfool.com/">Fossil Fool</a> installed on my bicycle for night-time rides.  I <i>finally</i> got a chance to take it out between rainstorms, and it's really fun!  It makes one's bike be more visible to automobiles, plus it gives me a bit of that "low rider" feeling that I have never had before, and probably never will again!
