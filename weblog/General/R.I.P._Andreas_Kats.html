<h1>R.I.P. Andreas Katsulas</h1>


<p>
Those who have known me for a long time know how big I was into Babylon 5 when it first came out; my virtual fingerprints are all still visible all over the <a href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/">Lurker's Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was sad to hear that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0441537/">Andreas Katsulas</a>, perhaps its best actor, certainly under-appreciated by the world at large, <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=34628">passed away a couple of days ago</a> at age 59.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-17526">Cigarettes were the cause</a>, lung cancer was the result.  Score yet another win for the Tobacco Industry, and a big loss for the rest of us.
