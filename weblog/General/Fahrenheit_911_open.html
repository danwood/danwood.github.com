<h1>Fahrenheit 911 opens 6/25: Buy your tickets in advance!</h1>


<p>
I'm really looking forward to seeing <a href="http://www.fahrenheit911.com/">Fahrenheit 911</a>, the movie that Fox News calls "a tribute to patriotism, to the American sense of duty &mdash; and at the same time an indictment of stupidity and avarice".   It's opening next weekend (Friday, June 25).  If it can kick butt at the box office on opening weekend, it will likely spread to more theaters around the US!
</p>
<p>
So why not commit to going on opening day or opening weekend?  You can <a href="http://www.f911tix.com/">get tickets online</a> so you won't have to worry about missing out if the theater is full.

(MoveOn's PAC is doing a campaign to get people to pledge that they will see the film on Opening Weekend ... if you're going, <a href="http://www.moveonpac.org/f911/">add your name</a>...)
