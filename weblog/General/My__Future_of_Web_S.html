<h1>My "Future of Web Services Applications" is online</h1>


<p>
My talk at the O'Reilly Mac OS X Conference (finishing today) is now available online from the 'home page' for my talk, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/macosx2003/view/e_sess/4453">right here</a>.</p>
<p>
Overall, it's been a great conference!

<b>Update:</b> <a href="http://www.karelia.com/images/weblog/dan_wood_future.pdf">Here</a> is a PDF version of the slides (modified slightly to compensate for the animations).  (Hint: Use the <a href="http://www.schubert-it.com/pluginpdf/">PDF Browser Plugin</a> to view PDFs directly from your browser rather than having to download 'em.)
