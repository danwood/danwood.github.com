<h1>biodegradable CDs</h1>


<p>
I heard about this listening to NPR the other day:  Sanyo has come up with a way to create <em>biodegradable</em> CDs, made out of <strong>corn</strong>.  Currently, CDs (music and data) don't biodegrade, and they are filling up landfills (though our local recycling company "recycles" them, as much as that means for plastic).  So making a polymer out of corn means that they can biodegrade.  (I wonder if I could add my unused backup CDs on the compost in the back yard?)  I'm assuming the process is similar to how Biocorp makes biodegradable <a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/news-info/99nov/fork.html">plasticware</a> out of corn.</p>

<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,112979,00.asp">Here</a> is a link to a story about 'em.  Sign me up!  (Except for the CDs that I actually want to last a long, long time, like my iPhoto archives!)
