<h1>Where are the rest of the 'Bush in 30 Seconds' ads?</h1>


<p>
... The ones that didn't quite make it to the winners' circle?

There were some other really cool ones!  Are you wondering what happened to them, like I am?  <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/bush30/petition.html">Sign the new petition</a> to convince MoveOn.org to put the other ads back online so we can all enjoy them...  And of course, pass along word about the petition to sympathetic friends, to help collect a bunch more names....
