<h1>I've taken the red pill</h1>


<p>
Like the majority of Americans, I'm not a Dubya-Bush kind of guy.  (OK, that's an understatement &mdash; stay tuned to this blog...)  Then again, I was pretty disenfranchised last election because the Democrats seemed to be not that much different than the Republicans.  Anyhow, I've been following Howard Dean's campaign because even though I don't agree with his take on 100 percent of the issues, he (and his campaign) seems to be actually people-powered, rather than being waged by and for the United States of Enron, to coopt a term from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375507523/ref=nosim/watson-20">Molly Ivins' book</a>.

<p>Tonight, I took the plunge and attended a <a href="http://blog.deanforamerica.com/archives/002694.html">Howard Dean event</a> in nearby San Francisco.  Based on what I heard tonight (what Gov. Dean said, not just Bonnie Raitt singing &mdash; wow!), and some transcripts of recent speeches he's given regarding employment in the country and race issues, I've decided to take the red pill.  Howard's my man now.  (Of course, I'll support whoever it takes to get Dubya out of office, but I just don't see many of the other more "establishment" democrats being much more than just "Republicrats" that are so fun to make fun of.  (Interestingly, one of Kerry's biggest online supporters has just dropped out, hat-tip to <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/2003_12_14_archive.html#a003685">Dori</a>)
</p>

Some interesting stats:  While Dubya raises gazillions from his corporate buddies, Dean's average campaign contribution is under $100.  But it's from just a whole lot of people.  (And, of course, <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/contribute">they are looking for more</a>.)  And 25 percent of Dean's contributors are <a href="http://www.generationdean.com/">under 30</a>.

I've never gotten involved in national politics before ... I guess there's a first time for everything.
