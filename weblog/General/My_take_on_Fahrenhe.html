<h1>My take on Fahrenheit 9/11</h1>


<p>
Well, the movie <a href="http://www.fahrenheit911.com/">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>, which I was looking forward to, has opened to record-breaking box office numbers.  Reviews of people that have actually seen the movie are very positive.  Reviews from people that refuse to see the movie are, predictably, less positive.

I was not disappointed ... which is nice; frequently a movie with a lot of anticipation is never as good as people build it up in advance.  But it just layered more and more unbelievable but true terrible facts about what is going on in our country, like a time capsule of the last four years that is just so powerful when compressed into two hours.
</p>

It was very much a different movie than I was expecting.  Sure, there were the over-the-top silly moments like the Bonanza send-off, the multiply-repeated buzzwords, ambushing unsuspecting members of Congress, and so forth.  People who aren't used to Michael Moore's style might find it annoying; I find it kind of refreshing, especially because it adds a bit of levity to otherwise heavy subjects of corruption and war.  But the second half of the movie, as it moved away from the stolen election and 9/11 discussion and into the very personal accounts of the war, its soldiers, and their families, I was completely stunned.  Instead of looking at the big picture, the rich leaders, and big attacks of war, Moore introduces us to Flint, Michigan resident Lila Lipscomb, the mother of a soldier in Iraq.  We get to know her story, and meet her family, and find out about her son.  And we see the war through her eyes.  And it's completely devastating.  I don't think there was a dry eye in the theater.

As I watched the movie, though, I kept thinking about how would some conservative people that I know react to the film.  If they could be convinced to go.
</p>
<p>
One of these guys I know was in the military during the Clinton years, and he told me he's a Bush man because he feels that Bush supports the military more than the Democrats would.  He might resist going to see the film, but if he saw it, he'd probably be moved at some level.  It's an amazing tribute to our soldiers; After seeing this film, I have never before had more empathy for the men and women who are stuck over in Iraq right now.   His pro-Bush stance would probably be challenged by the film, especially after learning of the horrible way that soldiers and veterans are treated by our administration.

Another conservative guy I know is a party-line Republican, who believes and echoes back everything that he's told to believe.  ("Of course there are Weapons of Mass Destruction, we just haven't found them yet"; "The economy is Clinton's fault, and it's getting better now", etc.)  He owns a local business that, well, essentially exploits the poor.  So even with all the revelations of the movie, showing how the rich are helping the rich get richer, and yet it's mostly the poor in the country that are the first ones to defend our freedoms,  I don't think he would be moved at all.  He'd be cheering on Cheney and Halliburton  in the movie.
</p>
<p>
I honestly believe ... or at least hope ... that most conservatives are that way because they believe in the perfectly reasonable conservative ideals (small government, fiscal responsibility, etc.) that the Republicans claim to follow, and are simply being misled.  From the reports that I'm hearing about reaction to the film in all parts of the country, including highly conservative areas, there may be hope.  This film may be the "uniter" -- not the "divider" -- that we all need.
