<h1>The wimpization of the holiday season</h1>


<p>
Used to be that starting around the first of December, people would say "Merry Christmas" to just about everybody they encountered.  That was fine enough for many, but not for the folks who don't <i>celebrate</i> Christmas.
</p>
<p>
So starting last year, I noticed that nobody said "Merry Christmas" anymore, trying not to offend those who might celebrate instead Channukah, Kwanzaa, Ramadan, the Winter Solstice, Festivus, or none of the above.  Instead, you'd hear "Happy Holidays."  Boy oh boy, has that gotten old quickly ... it's now more overused than the term "innovation" in Silicon Valley.
</p>
<p>
But now this year, it's gone even further. Every group that is doing something special this year seems to be having a  "Winterfest".  No holiday parties, certainly no "Christmas" parties....
</p>
<p>
What's next.... "Happy December"?
