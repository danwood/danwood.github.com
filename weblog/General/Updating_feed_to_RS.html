<h1>Updating feed to RSS 2.0</h1>


<p>
Prompted by a comment by Simone, I've updated the RSS feed for this weblog to RSS 2.0 &mdash; it was 0.91 before!  The weblog is still powered by Blosxom &mdash; I will start using Sandvox when I have the time to make the transition &mdash; and it's showing its age.
