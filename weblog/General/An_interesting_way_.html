<h1>An interesting way of jamming spammers</h1>


<p>
Take a look at the link at the bottom of <a href="http://www.the-wabe.com/stories/hoi-polloi.html">this page</a> ... it's abuse@<i>your ISP</i>.  Cool, it's a spam trap.  The email conversation on the aforementioned page, about somebody mistakenly thinking that they were being linked to, is amusing....
