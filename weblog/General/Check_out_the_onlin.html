<h1>Check out the online "commmercial" I created....</h1>

I've created something that is a little different from my "day job" of writing software.  I made a "commercial" that is now available online, that I wanted to share with readers here.  It's an entry in the "Bush in 30 Seconds" contest, in which people create a 30 second commercial that tries to point out the ... um ... flaws in our current Presidential Administration.  I'm hoping that mine will stand out from the others out there, because the goal of my ad is <i>not to "bash" Bush from a partisan standpoint</i>, but instead, to give credit where credit is due to Republicans ... but point out that Bush's legacy will be far different than those of Republicans like Lincoln, Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Reagan.  I call it <b>Republican Legacies.</b> The purpose is to point out to fence-sitters, Republicans, and everybody else that this this particular President, who happens to be a Republican, is doing terrible things to our country.

<p>
There were over 1500 (!) entries submitted; 1017 were qualified entries.  Yikes!  It would take 8-1/2 hours to watch them all straight through  Do I have a chance to win the competition? There are some <i>very</i> good ads &mdash; I' ve seen a small handful of them.  Maybe my "message" will be interesting for enough people....
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, I'm concerned enough about things that I took the time and effort to make this commercial, so I hope you'll give it a look.  If you like it, I hope you'll look at some of the other entries and, if you think it merits it, vote for it in the competition.

(BTW, the commercial was produced on a shoestring budget.  I used public domain images of presidents; I enlisted the voiceover talents of Beth Holland, a fellow Alameda resident; I spent $25 licensing the music ("Call to Arms" by Giovanni Lodigiani that I found on sounddogs.com); I put it all together with iMovie.)

(Unfortunately, it doesn't look like there's a way just to have you directly vote on mine, oh well.)
