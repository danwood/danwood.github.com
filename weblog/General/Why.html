<h1>Why?</h1>


<p>
<i>This is something I wrote after hearing <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/102304Y.shtml">Donna Marcus</a>, the mother of a woman who died in the 9/11 attacks, on the radio.  If you disagree with what I write, perhaps you at least will understand why a person like me, with so many unanswered questions, cannot support 4 more years of our country's current President.
