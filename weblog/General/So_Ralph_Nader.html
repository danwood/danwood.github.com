So, Ralph Nader is running for President.  Last time he did, I thought it was a good idea, but this time, it's sooooo different.

It looks like he's not getting much support for his run from his previous support base, so he's going to need all the help he can get from another source &mdash; the G.O.P.!

Since the G.O.P. will probably not be particularly forthcoming about their support, I thought I would give them a little help by creating these banners for your web site to support Ralph Nader's run for the Presidency.  Feel free to copy and distribute these at will!
