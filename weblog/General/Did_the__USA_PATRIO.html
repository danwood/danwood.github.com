<h1>Did the "USA PATRIOT" act really just get expanded?</h1>


<p>
I stumbled on something that I find hard to believe ... it's not being picked up by the mainstream media, but it has found its way onto <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/11/26/102049/62">kuro5hin</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,61341,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1">Wired News</a>, and there are various other references in a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=patriot+%28HR2417+OR+%22HR+2417%22%29&btnG=Google+Search">Google Search</a> &mdash; it looks like the same day the story broke about Saddam's capture*, Bush quietly signed HR 2417 into law which <em>expands</em> the USA PATRIOT act.  Some are calling it the dreaded "Patriot II" that no sane person could possibly be in favor of.  (But the mainstream media doesn't have a single mention of it &mdash; a <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=patriot+%28HR2417+OR+%22HR+2417%22%29&sa=N&tab=wn">comparable search on Google News</a> returns a result from "Conspiracy Planet" and another from Pravda &mdash; hardly mainstream!)  What gives?
