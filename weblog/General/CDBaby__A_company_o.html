<h1>CDBaby: A company on the "ClueTrain"</h1>


<p>
Here's an unsolicited testimonial.  I recently purchased some CDs from the store <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/">CDBaby.com</a>.  Their e-commerce site is nothing particularly special, but where they shine is in being silly.  Take for example this excerpt of the email I got from them annoncing that the CDs have shipped:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with
sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.
</p>
<p>
A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to make
sure they were in the best possible condition before mailing.
</p>
<p>
Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over
the crowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold-lined box that
money can buy.
</p>
<p>
We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party
marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of
Portland waved 'Bon Voyage!' to your package, on its way to you, in
our private CD Baby jet on this day, Monday, May 16th.
</p>
<p>
I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby.  We sure did. 
Your picture is on our wall as "Customer of the Year".  We're all
exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!

Lots of fun.  I'll probably order from them again.  Now if they would just put an RSS feed on their new arrivals list....
