I received this today.  It's obviously a scam, but I wonder how many people get suckered into providing enough information for somebody to potentially clean out your bank accounts.  An excerpt:
<blockquote>
Attention! In our global system of monitoring there was a technical failure.
In avoidance of frauds with your credit card enter the full data for authorization, otherwise your credit card will be frozen during 10 day. <i>[sic]</i>

The message contains an online HTML form (partial screenshot here) asking for personal information like mother's maiden name, social security number, password, credit card number, ATM PIN, billing address, and so forth.  <b>Chutzpah!</b>
