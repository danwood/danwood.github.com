<h1>How to boost your SBC/PacBell DSL speed and pay less</h1>


<p>
The message <a href="http://www.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub%2CViewListing.vm;jsessionid=9781D457DAB8C3F5B1E657E74C931FFE.worker1?messageid=a28d3df2-324a-416b-9125-a4d663f64ea9&directory=true">here</a> "Don't let SBC/PacBell jerk you around on DSL service" was forwarded to me over on Orkut, so I gave it whirl.  I had been paying $50/month for basic DSL service (384Kbps/128Kbps) with a static IP (since I started the service back so early -- now their service is Dynamic IP, but previous users are grandfathered in).  After talking to a few customer service representatives, my request was finally escalated to somebody who jokingly called herself the "great and powerful Oz."  I got to keep my static IP address, and I'm now paying $45/month for their "Expert Plus package" which is 1.5-3.0Mbps/384Kbps.  <i>Much</i> better.

If you have SBC/PacBell for your last-mile internet connection, or some other similar service, and you've been paying the same rates for a while, it probably doesn't hurt to check to see if the rates have lowered!
