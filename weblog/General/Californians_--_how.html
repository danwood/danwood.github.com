<h1>Californians -- how you can help get rid of electronic voting in our state</h1>


<p>Being in the computer industry, you would think that I am a big fan of electronic and computer innovations.  For the most part, that's absolutely true &mdash; but one place where I don't think we are ready yet is electronic voting.  The systems are incredibly insecure, subject to tampering, and completely unverifiable.  I want my vote to be counted, to be counted correctly, to be counted accurately, and to, if needed, be re-counted.  The current electronic voting systems in use now have problems with all of these issues.  I have serious doubts if my votes and my wife's votes were counted in the 2002 election.</p>
<p>
So in California, I heard on the news this morning that the Secretary of State is going to be making his decision in a few days about whether to decertify certain voting machines in some counties that had some problems.  But that's not enough ... they ALL need to go.
</p>
<p>
If you agree, please contact the Secretary of State's office &mdash; I just did, and spoke to a nice receptionist who diligently wrote down my comments.  Their number is (916) 657-2166.  And do it soon; apparently the decision is happening soon.
