<h1>Enjoying Air America Radio so far....</h1>


<p>
I'm listening to the inchoate radio network, <a href="http://www.airamericaradio.com/">Air America</a> Radio, over their Internet <a href="http://play.rbn.com/?url=airam/airam/live/live.rm&proto=rtsp">feed</a>.  After a bunch of technical problems with the stream yesterday, it seems to be pretty stable today.  (Terry has some tips for Mac OS X users <a href="http://www.talbotlucas.org/archives/000202.html">here</a>.)

Wow, some really heavy-hitter guests they have had so far!  How refreshing to be hearing radio that is not steeped in ultra-conservatism.  The ads are, of course, as obnoxious as on any AM station!  But for the American majority, who aren't fan's of the neocon agenda &mdash; whether it be confirmed Democrats, stepping-stone democrats, Republicans who feel that Bush has gone too far &mdash; you should check this out.

Still, it is not without its shortcomings.  Randi Rhodes has some good things to say, but in some interaction with callers, she sounds as pig-headed as Rush Limbaugh.  And I agree with Doc Searls' <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=7493&mode=thread&order=0">assessment</a> <small>[updated link]</small> assessment that they really need to take advantage of the Internet:
	<blockquote>
	[G]et out of the media mentality of old radio. Don't try to beat right wing radio at its own game. Start a new one.
