<h1>Examples of "RAW" photos?</h1>


<p>
Here's a question to ask of my five readers out there ... do any of you have any samples of "RAW" images, which the newest version of iPhoto supports?  I am trying to verify that the program I'm writing can read these kinds of files without going through any special hoops, but I don't have any sample images.  And Google hasn't been very helpful.

If you have any snapshots that you can point me to or email to me, I'd appreciate it.  (You can post a message, or find a working email address link <a href="http://www.karelia.com/contact/">here</a>.)
