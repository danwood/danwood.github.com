<h1>great other source for music</h1>

<a href="http://www.insanely-great.com/">Insanely Great</a> has a
<a href="http://www.insanely-great.com/news.php?id=5745"> posting</a> with praise for <a href="http://www.emusic.com/?tafisnid=F24D6EFA4EFC69ABB7132965C1F3726F&amp;fref=149089">eMusic</a>, an online music subscription download service.  Emusic doesn't have the top-of-the-charts stuff, but if you are interested in non-top-40 music, classical, jazz, etc., it's worth checking out.  You can download MP3s, and you get to keep  them after your subscription expires, so it might even be worth signing up for a short time, getting what you want, and then leaving.

I find it hard to browse online for music in general, and eMusic is no exception.  Still, if you have a "wish list", they might find you several hits, at far less expensive than ITMS.  I found a lot of stuff I had been meaning to get: Delerium, Thelonious Monk, Electronic, Se&ntilde;or Coconut, Sharon Shannon.  (Yes, my tastes are wide.)  And they have <a href="http://www.viennateng.com/">Vienna Teng</a>'s albums so how can you go wrong?
