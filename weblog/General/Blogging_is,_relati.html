<h1>Blogging is, relatively, easy again</h1>


<p>OK, I'll be the first to admit that I haven't been posting to my weblog lately.  The problem is that I immediately started using <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> 2.0 beta, never quite got over some problems I was having with <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> once it came out.  So I lost my ability to conveniently post from a nice user interface.
</p>
<p>
I've figured it out now, so blogging can continue at is previous breakneck pace.
