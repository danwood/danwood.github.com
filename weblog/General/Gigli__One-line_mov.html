<h1>Gigli: One-line movie review PLUS pronunciation Guide!</h1>


My weblog's first (and maybe last) one-line movie review, in <a href="http://www.raelity.org/">Rael</a>'s style.
<p />
Gigli:  Not as bad as I would have expected, this lighthearted movie about a thug's self-enlightenment is relatively enjoyable but otherwise forgettable ... except for its title, of course.
<p />
How is the name of the film and the protagonist pronounced?  This Italian name is near and dear to my heart, because it figures prominently in my family.  It's pronounced "<b>Jeel-yee</b>".  In the film, he says it "Jee-lee" (with, inexplicably, a French  soft J) which is certainly better than most English speakers can do.    Thanks to this film, people don't have to be an <a href="http://tenorland.com/gigli.html">opera</a> buff or a <a href="http://www.gigli.com/">fashion</a> maven (or speak Italian) to know how not to butcher a lovely name (which means "lillies" in Italian, by the way).

And now back to our regularly scheduled blogging.
