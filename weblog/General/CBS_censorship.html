<h1>CBS censorship</h1>


<p>
I'm starting to think that the Apple woman running with the hammer to smash the screen in Apple's Famous <a href="http://www.apple.com/hardware/ads/1984/">1984 Superbowl Commerical</a> needs to throw her hammer at CBS, for its Big-Brother-style censorship of commercial this year at the Superbowl.
</p>
<p>
If you haven't heard about this already, CBS is refusing to air an paid advertisement &mdash; <a href="http://www.moveon.org/cbs/ad/">see it online here</a> &mdash; that gently criticizes our nation's 1 trillion dollar deficit.
</p>
<p>
Say what?  Is an advocacy organization's 1.7 million dollars any less green than money that comes from tobacco companies and beer companies?  And why would CBS accept an ad from Bush's White House &mdash; sure to evoke controversy &mdash; but refuse this one, claiming that it is too controversial?  If one side can run an advertisement, shouldn't the other be allowed to as well?
</p>
<p>
I think that in a democracy, voices need to be heard, even if it's voices we don't agree with.  CBS has received over 340,000 messages asking them to stop their censorship.

Please, <a href="http://www.moveon.org/cbs/ad/">watch the ad and send CBS your comments.</a>
