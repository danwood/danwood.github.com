Wow.  <a href="http://www.fatmixx.com/index.php?m=20030715#328">This Post</a> in Sujal Shah's weblog talks about some really amazing news for him.  Sujal, as you may know, is the author of some of Watson's cool contributed tools, the Football and Baseball scores ones.  Well, based on these Watson plugins, he landed himself a job at ESPN.com!
