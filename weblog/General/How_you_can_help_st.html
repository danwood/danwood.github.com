<h1>How you can help stop genocide</h1>


<p>
I've just been reading that there is <a href="http://passionofthepresent.com/">genocide going on in Sudan</a>.    And under <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/genocide.html">international agreement</a>, a nation must intervene to stop a genocide when it is officially acknowledged,
</p>
<p>
Our government has been focusing a lot of "liberating" Iraq so maybe it's time to step up to the plate, officially acknowledge what is going on, and liberate Sudan.

The new website, <a href="http://passionofthepresent.com/">PassionOfThePresent</a>, tracks the effort to stop genocide.  It has suggestions on what we ordinary people can do &mdash; like contact our <a href="http://capwiz.com/churchworld/dbq/officials/">Representatives and Senators</a> and ask them to support H. Con. Res. 403 [House] and <a href="http://capwiz.com/churchworld/issues/bills/?bill=5571286">S. Con. Res 99</a> [Senate &mdash currently sponsored by Lieberman (D-CT), Durbin (D-IL), Brownback (R-Kansas), Kennedy (D-MA), and Feingold (D-WI)].  I'm going to contact <i>my</i> representatives shortly.
