<h1>I'll be presenting at the Diablo Valley MUG on April 15th</h1>


While many of us will be working on getting out our <a href="http://www.warresisters.org/piechart.htm">income taxes</a> at the last minute, I'll be at the meeting of the <a href="http://www.dvmug.org/">Diablo Valley Macintosh User Group</a> in Walnut Creek, California, talking about who knows what.  They will probably convince me to show off a few features from the upcoming update to Watson.  If you're in the East Bay, come to the meeting and say Hi!
