<h1>Two-sentence review of the first Presidential Debate</h1>


<p>I'm glad President Bush wore a blue tie.  It complemented his red face.

<small><b>Update:</b> I hate to have to explain a joke, it lessens the impact.  But I assumed that everybody saw what I saw &mdash; which was an unchanging split screen, showing both candidates <em>all the time</em>.  So what many people might not have seen was that almost every time Kerry spoke, Bush's face turned a deep, deep red out of anger or embarrassment.
