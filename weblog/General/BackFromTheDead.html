<h1>Back from the Dead</h1>


<p>
OK, not quite that bad.  Just a period of blogging silence.   A lot of people had a lot to say after November 2nd; I, on the other hand, was stunned and silent, both in the weblogging context and also in my real life.  But life goes on.
</p>
<p>
One thing I'd like to do is reorganize this weblog a little.  Maybe take my personal rants to another weblog and keep this site computer-oriented.  (I've gotten a lot of negative comments from some very negative people whenever I post anything resembling an opinion around here.  So maybe this should be the last time I do so!)
</p>
<p>
Another thing I want to add is a section on <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/Cocoa">Cocoa</a> (<a href="http://rss.karelia.com/MacOSX">RSS feed</a>).  Geeky Content for Geeky Mac Developers.  This is just a new category that will show up as part of the standard weblog page or feed.  I'll be talking about technical concepts and issues that affect Cocoa developers for Mac OS X.  (Note this is distinct from <a href="http://cocoa.karelia.com/">cocoa.karelia.com</a>, a repository of open-source snippets.)
</p>
<p>
People who are just interested in Mac-related, non technical, non General topics, can read just the "MacOSX" category <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX">here</a>. (Or subscribe to its  <a href="http://rss.karelia.com/MacOSX">RSS feed</a>.)  The "Watson" category, like the program, is now officially retired, though I may still talk about the program in the "MacOSX" category.</p>
