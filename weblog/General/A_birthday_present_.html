<h1>A birthday present for my father: Publishing his children's book</h1>


<p>Today is my father's Birthday.  As a present to him, I'm publishing, on the Internet, a children's book that he wrote 30 years ago.</p>


<p>The book is <cite>The Pickle Machine</cite> and the author is Ken Wood.  It's one of three children's books that he wrote when <em>I</em> was a child.  He sent them to several publishing houses, with no luck.</p>

<p>Decades later, I read the books to <em>my</em> kids.  Their grandfather takes great delight in that!</p>

<p>So now as a way for other kids to appreciate this cute story, I scanned the pages and color-corrected to compensate for the yellowing paper, typed in the text, and formatted it somewhat like a small book.</p>

<p>So ... if you have kids, it might be worth a couple of minutes to download the PDF.  Get it from <a href="http://www.gigliwood.com/kenwood/pickle/">this page</a>.</p>

<p>It's not like it's in bookstores, but it might give a few kids a few smiles.  If you like it, drop me a line so I'll be encouraged to scan his other two titles....  And if you can think of any other places from which to link to its page, please let me know.</p>
