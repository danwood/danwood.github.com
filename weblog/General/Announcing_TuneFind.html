<h1>Announcing TuneFinder X</h1>

Years ago, I ran across a Hypercard stack that contained an index of thousands of classical music melodies.  I grew up in a house with classical music playing all the time, so I know a lot of the music, but I can't actually name more than a handful of pieces.  I found this program to be invaluable!
<p />
But not many of us have HyperCard anymore, and I hated the idea of this great concept and database languishing.  So I looked up the author of the system, Elbert G. Smith, who first started collecting records around 1940!  First on 3 x 5 cards, then punched cards, then eventually HyperCard.
<p />
I got a hold of the latest database -- now at version 4.11 with over 13,000 entries -- and built a little Cocoa application around it.  There aren't a lot of bells and whistles in this early version, but I wanted to make it available to others to elicit feedback and let people play with it.  And it's freeware.

I've put the current version of the HyperCard stack online as well, in case anybody wants to make use of it.  This version has not been available online until now.
