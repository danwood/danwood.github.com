<h1>In Memory of Actor Richard Biggs</h1>


<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0081863/">Richard Biggs</a> was one of my favorite actors from one of my favorite TV series, <a href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/">Babylon 5</a>.  He passed away a few days ago.
</p>
<p>
John Hudgens, who has put together some great video compilations of scenes from Babylon 5, made an amazing tribute video (<a href="http://www.theforce.net/theater/temp/RickBiggs.html">Quicktime</a>) showing footage from Babylon 5 of his character, Dr. Stephen Franklin, reflecting the joys of life and living.
</p>
<p>
Amazingly well-done and touching.
