<h1>"RSS" vs. "XML"</h1>


<p>
There's a great article over at <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Radar</a> (which is where some great O'Reilly folks have been blogging lately, leaving their usual blogs behind in the dust) called <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/05/rssnoxmlnouhbot.html">"RSS"...no..."XML"...no...uh...both?</a>.  It captures the thoughts that I have been having lately about those RSS/XML badges.  A great quick read.
