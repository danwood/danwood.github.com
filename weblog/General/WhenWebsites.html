<h1>When Websites go South</h1>


<p>
I'm working on some programming, and I need to get some stuff from the WebDAV website, <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">webdav.org</a>.  And the darn site has been down for at least the last couple of days.  I can't reach it, and it doesn't seem reachable from other places I've checked.
</p>
<p>
Maybe they will get it fixed over the weekend.  I sure hope so.
</p>
<p>
Happy Thanksgiving to all who do that kind of thing!
