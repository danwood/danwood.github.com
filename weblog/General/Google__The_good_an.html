<h1>Google: The good and the bad</h1>


<p>
While not-related-to me Molly wood <a href="http://themolly.com/mt/archives/000128.html">blogs</a> about Google's troubles, I thought I would join in by pointing out one good thing and one bad thing about Google.
</p>
<p><div style="clear:both; float: right; padding:3px; " />
<form action="http://www.google.com/search" name=f>
<input type=hidden name=hl value=en>
<input type=hidden name=ie value="UTF-8">
<input type=hidden name=oe value="UTF-8">
<input type=hidden name=q value="Watson">
<input type=submit value="I'm Feeling Lucky" name=btnI>
</form>
</div>
The good:  I've just found out that when you search for Watson, it's now the top entry, meaning that the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button will take you right to Watson's home page.  Watson has been below the PC program "Dr. Watson" for an eternity -- it looks like my program has finally gotten a bit more mindshare!  Yipee!

The bad: Apparently Google has decided that it can censor organizations like <a href="http://ga0.org/campaign/googleoutrage">this</a> one that criticize the polluting behavior of ocean cruse ships.  Isn't that special?  To quote the petition:
<blockquote>
Google should reinstate the Oceana AdWords immediately and show that it supports free expression of all viewpoints, not just those sponsored by corporate interests.  Google's motto has always been "Don't be evil" -- this would seem to be a great opportunity to live up to those noble words.
