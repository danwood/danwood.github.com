<h1>Today is 'Buy Nothing Day'</h1>


Today is <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/">Buy Nothing Day</a> -- which for me is just about the easiest "holiday" to celebrate, because you participate by not participating ... in the huge shopping spree that seems to overwhelm America the day after thanksgiving.  I thought the <a href="http://www.ehso.com/ehshome/FoodSafety/foodtryptophan.php">tryptophan</a> in the turkey was supposed to make people sleepy, not burn holes in their pockets.  Anyhow, I for one am happy to avoid stores on the most crowded day of the year.  (Except that -- darn -- we didn't have enough milk in the fridge!)
