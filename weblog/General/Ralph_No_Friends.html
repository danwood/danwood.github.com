<h1>Does Ralph have any friends left?</h1>


<p>
This is cool.  <a href="http://TheUnityCampaign.org">The Unity Campaign</a> (formerly RalphDontRun.net) recently convinced most of Ralph Nader's original 2000 "Citizens Committee" to unite behind an endorsement of John Kerry.  We're talking Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Jim Hightower, Bonnie Raitt, etc.

Does Ralph have <i>any</i> friends left?

BTW if you're interested in helping get out the message that Ralph's former supporters are abandoning his egostistical crusade, you can <a href="http://activate.progressiveunity.net/t?ctl=931318:296A441">donate to their ad campaign</a> which is going to target 1.6 million readers of alternative weekly newspapers.  They are trying to raise $18,000 in the next 48 hours.

I made a contribution and now I have that "donation high"....
