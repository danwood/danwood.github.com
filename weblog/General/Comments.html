<h1>Comments (writebacks) now enabled for this weblog</h1>


I've installed the <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/plugins/input/writeback.htm">WriteBack</a> plugin for <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> so now this weblog will accept comments.  I still am not particularly hip to all the nomenclature and culture around "writebacks" and "trackbacks" (e.g. what the heck is a trackback ping, why is there XML in my writeback page, etc.) but the main point is that you can now add your comments.  Until the spammers start abusing this, of course.  :-)
