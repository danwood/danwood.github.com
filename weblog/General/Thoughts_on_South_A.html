<h1>Thoughts on South Africa's Tenth Anniversary as a democracy</h1>


<p>
South Africa has just celebrated <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-safr28.html">10 years of democracy</a>.  It seems like just yesterday that I first heard about this atrocity that was taking place on the other side of the world.
</p>
<p>
Coincidentally, I ran across a couple of interesting chilling numbers a few days ago:
</p>
<table border="1"><tr><td colspan="2">Incarceration rates in George W. Bush's America and Stalin's U.S.S.R.</td></tr>
<tr><td>U.S.S.R. (1950)</td><td align="right">1,423 per 100,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>U.S.A. (2002)</td><td align="right">2,298 per 100,000</td></tr>
</table>
<br />
<table border="1"><tr><td colspan="2">Incarceration rate of black men in South Africa before ANC rule and in contemporary America</td></tr>
<tr><td>South Africa (1993)</td><td align="right">851 per 100,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>U.S.A. (2002)</td><td align="right">7,150 per 100,000</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
How very, very sad.  America is the new South Africa; the new U.S.S.R.
