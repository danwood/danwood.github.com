<h1>Mashups: Musical Photoshopping</h1>


<p>
Lately, I've discovered <em>mashups</em> &mdash; for the uninitiated, it's digitally combining two (or more) songs into a (hopefully) pleasing new composition, an unintended duet.  It's the musical equivalent of taking two completely different works of art and blending elements of one into another using PhotoShop; imagine inserting Marilyn Monroe into a Boticelli painting, for instance.  Usually they juxtapose a currrently popular artist with a classic song from the 70s or 80s.

You can find mashup mp3 files all over the web; some of the ones that I like the most come from <a href="http://www.gohomeproductions.co.uk/">Go Home Productions</a>.   It helps when I actually <em>know</em> one or all of the songs involved, so mixing two songs on today's pop charts doesn't do much for me.  A particular favorite is GHP's <a href="http://www.vidler.btinternet.co.uk/allendean/raprider.mp3">Rapture Riders</a>, mixing Blondie's "Rapture" with the Doors' "Riders On The Storm."
