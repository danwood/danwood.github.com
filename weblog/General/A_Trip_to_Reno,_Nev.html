<h1>A Trip to Reno, Nevada</h1>


<p>I took a quick trip from California to Nevada yesterday to help identify and persuade potential voters who want to take their country back.  What a blast!  Four of us drove up from the San Francisco Bay Area &mdash; from a state whose electoral votes are all but a given &mdash; to Nevada, a state with only five electoral votes that could go either way.  So Nevada is turning into quite the political battleground &mdash; in fact, it's apparently so close that it's  now tied for the #1 contested state in the country.  It could be 2004's Florida, so to speak.  So the state is filling up with volunteers from both sides (unfortunately) of the political divide.

If any of you readers of this weblog are in California and you want to actually make a difference in the election &mdash; and to paraphrase Moby, not to wake up on November 3 and regret that you didn't do enough &mdash; this is something you can do that will have <i>significant</i> impact.  Nevada needs ground troups.  If you want to know how to get involved, <a href="http://www.karelia.com/contact/?Mailbox=weblog">contact me</a> and I'll be glad to help you get set up.  (They especially need help the weekend before Election Day; there's also a couple of <a href="http://www.turnnevadablue.com/">big events</a> in Reno next weekend and on October 13th.)

<p>If you're outside the area but you still want to help, <a href="http://www.active.com/donations/fundraise_public.cfm?key=eb4d">money talks</a> of course.
