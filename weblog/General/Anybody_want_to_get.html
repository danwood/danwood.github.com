<h1>Anybody want to get a free one-issue subscription to WIRED?</h1>


<p>
I got an offer in the mail from WIRED magazine (which I've started subscribing to again) to send a free issue to a friend -- basically a single issue subscription.   Rather than asking everybody I know, I thought I'd check with the blaudience here.

If anybody is interested, drop me a line at the email address below the orange RSS badge on this web page.  If you're the first person to respond, I'll reply to get your snail-mail address so I can put it on the form and send it away.
</p>
<p>
Update: SOLD.  :-)
