<h1>Question for our readers: How to make old-fashioned record clicks / pops / scratches?</h1>


I'm working on a personal project, and wondering if anybody is familiar with sound software (or just a library of sound effects) that I could add to some music to simulate clicks and pops of an old-fashioned record (remember those?), including the repeated loud pop when a record is stuck, and of course the Ally McBeal sound effect of the needle being yanked across the record.  If you have any suggestions, please send me an email at: comments "at" karelia "dot" com [or leave a comment here, now that this is enabled on this weblog].
