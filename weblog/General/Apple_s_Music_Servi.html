<h1>Apple's Music Service:  Inevitable and creatively stifling</h1>


Unless you've been focusing on more important issues, you're probably aware of Apple's new online music service.  Apple says it is "revolutionary" and it's making the music industry be "reborn."
<p />
I say it was inevitable, and quite the opposite of what I would have hoped Apple would do.  It really is more of a Microsoft kind of thing to do.
<p />
Apple used to be about empowering the "little guy" to do creative stuff.  Desktop publishing and iMovie are great examples of this.  Apple's music service, on the other hand, does just the opposite.
<p />
Why?  It is a clearinghouse for the big music labels -- the same megacorporations that are stagnating.  Chances are next to nil that I'll ever find a lot of the artists in my collection, such as Bay Area-based Eastern European vocal ensemble <a href="http://www.kitka.org/">Kitka</a>, my three-year-old daughter's favorite <a href="http://www.davidjack.com/">David Jack</a>, MIDI Guitar wizard <a href="http://www.markdwane.com/">Mark Dwane</a>, Oakland-based electropop band <a href="http://www.thelovemakers.com/">The Lovemakers</a>, Italian superstar crooner <a href="http://www.laurapausini.com/">Laura Pausini</a>, or ambient/trance <a href="http://www.spiderbytes.com/ambientrance/del-k.htm">Delerium</a>.  
<p />
And yet I can go to the bands' web sites, my local record store or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/watson-20">amazon.com</a> and get their music.
<p />
If Apple wanted to do something and revolutionary, they could have done something much more extraordinary that would have not only included the big names, but also allowed the "little guys" to make their music available over iTunes.

<p />
Come on, Apple.  Think Different.
