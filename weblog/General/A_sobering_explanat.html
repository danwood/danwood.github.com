<h1>A sobering explanation of Global Warming by Professor ... Gore???</h1>


<p>
Vice President Gore would have made a good professor!  I've just watched a sobering and very educational lecture -- not even <i>that</i> political -- by the former VP talking about Global Warming.  Wow, what an eye-opener.  I have been vaguely aware that it's a problem at some level, but now I'm realizing that this is a problem that, if unchecked, is going to have a significant effect in <b>my lifetime</b> and certainly my childrens'.  (Living on Earth now is like the frog in the pot of water that is slowly getting warmer and warmer, never getting out in time to avoid being boiled to death!)

<b>I highly recommend everybody check this out.</b>   <i>Even if you're a Republican,</i> you should learn about this.  Gore gave due credit to Republican Teddy Roosevelt for being a great conservationist and forming the national park system!  It's quite an eye-opener, and it gives me hope that we can solve this problem if we put our collective minds to the problem.
