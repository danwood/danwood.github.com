<h1>Web-based e-mail reader that blocks spam?</h1>


Here's a question for the readership of this weblog -- does anybody know of a web-based e-mail reader (like <a href="http://www.Mail2Web.com">Mail2Web</a>, <a href="http://www.MailStart.com">MailStart</a>, and the many listed <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Internet/E-mail/Web-Based/POP3_Access/?tc=1">here</a>) that <b>blocks spam</b>, maybe the way that <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Mail</a> does?
<p />
I'm about to hit the road for a while, and I've grown accustomed to Apple Mail's spam filters, which catch maybe 90% of incoming spam.   Using Web-based mail readers, the amount of spam is intolerable, but it could be kept in check if the system had a filter like <a href="http://useast.spamassassin.org/">SpamAssassin</a> installed.....
<p />
(Yes, I know you can install filters like SpamAssassin on the mail host; but I haven't been able to accomplish that [yet].  If anybody has any suggestions, drop me a line -- mailto link is at the bottom of the page and I'll post any good answers; I don't have comments set up on this weblog yet.....)
<p />
<b>Update:</b> Martin recommended <a href="http://www.fastmail.fm/">FastMail</a>; Sam recommended <a href="http://www.squirrelmail.org/">SquirrelMail</a> -- though SquirrelMail is something you install on your own server.  Thanks!
