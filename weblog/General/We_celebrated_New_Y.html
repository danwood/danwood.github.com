<h1>We celebrated New Years a day early (with a list of my favorite Bush in 30 Seconds ads)</h1>


<p>
Last night, we had a New Year's party at our house.  Not a typical New Year's party, but one of 1400+ house parties around the country dedicated to take back our country from "King George" and learn more about the person whom I personally believe is capable of improving our lives, <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/">Howard Dean</a>.  We had about 30 friends and neighbors show up, plus their kids.  Besides the usual food, drinks, conversation, and music, we showed a DVD with a brief bio of Dean, and Al Gore's recent <a href="http://38.117.149.175/interface/qtPlayer.asp?path=rtsp://38.117.149.179/elements/d97753c3-9e70-4709-92f3-64b1b67904cd/dean_gore_iowa_256k.mov">endorsement</a> of Dean.  Plus, we showed a compilation of some of my favorite entries &mdash; listed below &mdash; to the <a href="http://www.bushin30seconds.org/">Bush in 30 Seconds contest</a>.
</p>
<p>
(Americans who want to take our country back are encouraged to contribute even small amounts to the campaign to go up against Bush's big-business war-chest.  You can <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/site/TR?fr_id=1282&pg=personal&px=1712422"> contribute via our party's home page</a> -- beneath the image of the baseball bat, click the "Contribute" link.
