<h1>Our Votes Must Be Counted</h1>


<p>
I just signed a petition, to send to Congress and the secretaries of state of every state planning to use electronic voting machines, to ensure that our voting systems leave a paper trail.
</p>
<p>
After the Florida debacle, with all the flaws in the voting systems there, at least <em>the votes could be re-counted</em> if there was a problem.  With the electronic voting machines in place in some states, some voters won't be able to verify their choices.  No receipt is printed.  There's no way of recounting the votes if there is a problem.  And worse yet, from what I understand, the information is transmitted over insecure means, using verifiably crackable Microsoft technologies.
</p>
<p>And when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it turns out that the head of the major supplier of these machines is  a major contributor to one of the candidates.  (Does is matter which one?  This is clearly not an impartial manufacturer of black-box technology!)
</p>
<p>
Please <a href="http://petition.democracyforamerica.com/page/p/verify/3270">sign the petition</a>.  It can't hurt, can it?
