<h1>An interesting Read: Tipping Point</h1>


<p>
Yesterday, at our local <a href="http://www.booksinc.net/">bookstore</a>, I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/tippingpoint/index.html">Tipping Point</a>: How Little Things Can Make a Difference, by Malcolm Gladwell.  I almost completely devoured it last night.  A really interesting read; it's a little bit psychology, sociology, marketing, history, and though not really stated explicitly, chaos theory.  I like the discussion of the three types of people who help get ideas to spread: the Connector, somebody who knows a lot of people, even weakly (The people on the social networks with the super high numbers are those kind of people); the Maven, the person who just loves to be an expert at stuff and share that information with others; and the Sales<strike>man</strike>person, who has this innate ability to convince people of just about anything.  Anybody with a weblog is probably at least a little bit of one or more of these categories!
