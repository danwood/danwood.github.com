<h1>Thoughts on Orkut</h1>


<p>
I was invited to join <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> today.  It's pretty cool.  I've avoided the various social networking sites before because they seemed too much like teenage chat rooms and dating services; Orkut, on the other hand, seems sufficiently geeky and geared toward business contacts.  So I'm giving it a try.
</p>
<p>
The invitation-only way of getting in is kind of funny.  If you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=orkut&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">Google for Orkut</a>, you'll see that you can <i>buy</i> an invitation!  Wow, that kind of defeats the purpose of networking, doesn't it?  <i>[Readers of this weblog who actually <b>know</b> me, personally or over e-mail, drop me a line if you want an invite.  Gratis.]</i>
</p>
<p>
One caveat:  There are still "dating" aspects to the service, which you can use if you are so inclined.  But don't make the same mistake I did, which was to stumble upon the personal profile of people I've known for years from a business and computer sense, to find out what their turn-ons and contents of their bedroom are.  <b>Yuck!</b>  I'm scarred for life!
