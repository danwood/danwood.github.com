The <a href="http://www.moveon.org/">MoveOn.org</a> <a href="https://www.moveonvoterfund.org/">voter fund</a> has just posted a <a href="https://www.moveonvoterfund.org/images/santa.pdf">print</a> and <a href="https://www.moveonvoterfund.org/images/santa.mov">video</a> ad talking about President Bush's "Christmas List".  Definitely worth checking out.

I realize that many readers of my weblog may <i>like</i> Bush, and for those of you, feel free to "move on."  But I suspect that a lot of Americans, even the most dyed-in-the-wool Republicans, are seeing the American Dream fade away under our current leadership.  If you are tired of this trend, I encourage you to check out MoveOn.org, and get involved.  They are a nonpartisan group, not affiliated with any political party.  Right now, they are having a membership drive to get more people on board, and thanks to some matching funds, any new member joining with a contribution of at least $20 (less than the license to a half-decent software program!), they'll get a matching donation of another $20.  <a href="https://www.moveonvoterfund.org/donate/new.html?id=2194-2838151-wdI3liwZGZJWjnx6JtpC7Q">Follow this link here</a>.  <i>Update: GregW pointed out that this was an insecure URL; I changed it to https</i>
