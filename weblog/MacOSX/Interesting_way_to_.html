<h1>Interesting way to collect technical info about your Mac</h1>


<p>
This is an advanced tip about collecting all kinds of technical information about your Mac's configuration.  It packages up all kinds of configuration information, zips it up, and puts it into a temporary folder.  Maybe somebody reading this will find it an interesting tidbit.  <b>It's an advanced, command-line tool</b> so don't worry about it if you're not a command-line power user!
