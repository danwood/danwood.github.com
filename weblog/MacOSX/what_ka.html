<h1>What Karelia Software Has Been Up To</h1>



<p> 
At 5 O'clock Pacific time, we put a new face on the <a 
href="http://www.karelia.com/">Karelia</a> website.</p> 
<p> 
For quite a while now, I &mdash; and my partner at Karelia, Terrence 
Talbot &mdash; have been working on our next big thing.  We're not 
ready to release by any means, but we are ready to give the Mac 
blogosphere a preview of what is coming from Karelia later this year 
(and something else to think about besides the whole Intel thing). Our 
application is called <b><a 
href="http://www.sandvox.com">Sandvox</a></b>, and it is &mdash; in 
six words or less &mdash; an "iApp" for creating web sites. 
</p> 
<p> 
We are here at Apple's WWDC this week, to get refreshers and the 
latest scoop on the technologies which we have been using &mdash; or 
will be soon using &mdash; inside the application. And, we're showing 
demos of the program (still in alpha state) to fellow developers,
since there will be a n umber of plugin opportunities.
 There are a lot of great features in the app that we are excited about 
that aren't at all obvious by our web site; our new <a 
href="http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/">Sandvox Development Blog</a> 
(itself built by our program) will be helping to fill in some details 
in the months to come as we get closer to release.  Be sure to 
subscribe to it <a 
href="http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/index.xml">(RSS FEED)</a> to be 
kept in the loop.

we are showcasing a selection of the Sandvox's site designs on that 
page.
