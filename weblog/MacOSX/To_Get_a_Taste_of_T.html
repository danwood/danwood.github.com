<h1>To Get a Taste of Tiger's Quartz Composer....</h1>


<p>
Yesterday I <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/Cocoa/It_s_Hard_to_Report.html">blogged</a> (in the "<a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/Cocoa">Cocoa</a>" category) about an upcoming tool that Apple just wrote about called Quartz Composer (at the bottom of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/tiger/coreimage.html">this page</a>).  Thanks to David Nolen's comment, the rest of the Mac world can now get a hint as to what this is all about.  The program comes from an application called PixelShox, the old version of which is still available at <a href="http://www.pol-online.net/pixelshox_technology/">this page right here</a>.

Mac Developers, Power-users, and Graphic Nuts may find it interesting to download it and try it out to get a taste of what to expect with Tiger....
