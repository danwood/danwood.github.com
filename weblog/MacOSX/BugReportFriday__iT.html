<h1>BugReportFriday: iTunes Selection</h1>


<p>
This week's bug report to Apple is about iTunes.  Not the UI of 5.0, but just a simple feature request.  I want to be able to quit iTunes, and when it re-launches, restore whatever selection was chosen in playlists, browser, and main list.

I'm tired of launching iTunes and always seeing 10,000 Maniacs when I launch iTunes!

As usual, I suggest that you, dear reader, <a href="https://bugreport.apple.com/">file a bug</a> yourself.  Echo the sentiments of this one if you wish, or come up with one of your own.</b> (<a href="http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/bugrptform.html">Use this form </a> if you don't have an Apple Developer Account.)  Then if you have a del.icio.us account, tag your weblog report about your bug with <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/applebugfriday">applebugfriday</a>.
