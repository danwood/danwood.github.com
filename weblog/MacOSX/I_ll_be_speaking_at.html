<h1>I'll be speaking at the O'Reilly Mac OS X Conference in October</h1>


O'Reilly had announced the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/macosx2003/">2003 Mac OS X Conference</a>, taking place in Santa Clara, California in October.  Lots of Mac dignitaries and visionaries will be speaking at the conference.  <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/macosx2003/view/e_sess/4453">I'll be there</a> as well, talking about "The Future of Web Services."
<p />
Four months to get those slides together ... I hope that's enough time!   :-)
