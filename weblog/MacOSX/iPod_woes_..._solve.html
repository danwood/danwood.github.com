<h1>iPod woes ... solved!</h1>


<p>I updated my iPod and iTunes to their latest versions yesterday, wondering if I was going to have problems like I did a short while ago, where the process of trying to update my iPod caused iTunes and even the whole Mac to freeze up.
</p>
<p>Sure enough, I had similar problems.  Last time, I discovered that my Belkin 6-port FireWire hub's power supply wasn't plugged in all the way (a bad design I reported to Belkin without any reply from them &mdash; you'd think that if something is not plugged in properly, it wouldn't show a glowing <em>green</em> light!) and fixing that made the problems go away.
</p>
<p>This time, I checked my connections, and the hub had gotten partly unplugged again.  I pushed the adaptor, rebooted, and tried again. Did that fix things? <em>No.</em>  So I took the hub out of the equation and plugged the iPod connector directly into the Mac.  Another reboot, another try.  Did that fix things?  <em>No!</em>
</p>
<p>Running out of ideas, I browsed the discussion lists at Apple's support site, and found this interesting thread: <a href="http://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?14@159.HF38aTsplgZ.1@.68924a16">iPod and iTunes freeze during update</a>  Somebody suggested that the iSight and iPod can't be plugged into the computer at the same time, due to power usage problems.  So I unplugged my iSight, and <b>yipee</b>, the iPod is happily transferring the almost 40 gigs of music to my iPod as I type this.
</p>
<p>So ... if you are using an iSight and an iPod, <em>unplug your iSight while you are using your iPod.</em>
