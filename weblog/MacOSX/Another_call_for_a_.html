<h1>Another call for a CSS guru</h1>


<p>
Back in June when we first revealed our work on Sandvox, I <a href="http://www.gigliwood.com/weblog/MacOSX/Looking_for_CSS_Cod.html">put out a call</a> (actually, <a href="http://gigliwood.com/weblog/MacOSX/Web_Designer_Needed.html">another call</a> even earlier) for some Web Designers/CSS coder gurus who could help us with creating designs for Sandvox.  Our response was great &mdash; it seems that there were more talented people who read my weblog than I was able to find through neo-traditional methods like advertising on <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/">Craig's List</a>!
</p>
<p>
Well, even though we are close to releasing Sandvox, our CSS needs are not over.  In fact, they may have just begun.  Unfortunately, the web designers/CSS coders that we found have become gainfully employed full-time, and are unable to continue helping us out.
</p>
<p>
So, let me throw down the gauntlet again.  We are looking for a contractor who knows CSS well, who can do the technical work of building a layout according to our specification, modifying existing designs that need fixing, and making sure the designs work well across all modern browsers and IE as well.  Ideally, this person will also have good design skills as well, and can produce layouts along the lines of those currently found on <a href="http://www.karelia.com/">our website</a> and sites like <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>.
</p>
<p>
If this is you, drop me a line: dwood at karelia.  If you know somebody who might be up for this, please pass the word along.
