<h1>BugReportFriday: Oldie Moldies</h1>


<p>
Since I got in some early bug reports on the horrors of the new iTunes interface, I thought for today's Apple Bug Report Friday, I would dig into the archives to showcase some bugs that I have reported in the past.  Bugs that are still open.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="rdar://2812414">2812414</a>, dated November 2001, almost four years ago!     Regular menus and the "special" menus (on the right side of the menu bar) cause throbbing defaults buttons to stop throbbing.  Results seem to vary depending on whether the application with the button is a carbon or cocoa application, and whether it's a regular menu or a special menu.  (OK, not as high-priority as a kernel panic, but it subtly makes the mac look not-very-multithreaded.)</li>
<li><a href="rdar://3009823">3009823</a>, dated July 2002.  A feature request for Apple's Mail application to provide a way for senders to specify their icon in their mail messages.  Right now, you only get a 64x64 picture of the messsage sender in the corner of your message if (a) they are in your address book and you have their picture there, (b) they are sending from their mac.com account and they've set their image there <em>(Does this still happen?)</em>, or (c) they are members of the Mail team working at Apple (images are in the "senders.tiff" file).  It would be nice to specify, via an "X-" header, the image data (or URL for those data to be fetched from).
<li><a href="rdar://3011958">3011958</a>, also July 2002.  An enhancement request for iChat to use the speech synthesizer so that you could set up the "new message received" event to speak the text of the incoming message, instead of an announcement that there is a message.  And have per-buddy voice preferences.
</li>
<ul>
