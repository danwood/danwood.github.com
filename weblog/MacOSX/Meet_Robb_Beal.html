<h1>Meet Robb Beal</h1>


<p>
<a href="http://www.usercreations.com/robb/meet.html">Robb Beal</a>, who served as product manager and user interface guru on Watson for a while (before the Sherlock 3 hit the fan), and more recently known as the creator of <a href="http://www.usercreations.com/spring/">Spring</a>, is looking for a new gig.  I highly recommend him for any developers who may need his services.
