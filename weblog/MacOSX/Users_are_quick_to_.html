<h1>Users are quick to move to Panther</h1>


<p>Just for fun, I ran some numbers to see how many Watson users have upgraded to Panther.
</p>
<p>
When somebody launches Watson, the program contacts Karelia.com to check for updates and news.  Part of that request is an indication of what version of the OS is being used, just so I can collect these kinds of stats.
</p>
<p>
So yesterday &mdash; <em>two days after the release of Panther</em> &mdash; this is how Watson users were distributed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>46.4% on Panther</li>
	<li>52.4% on Jaguar</li>
	<li>1.2% on Puma (10.1)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Pretty interesting!  Of course, these numbers aren't anything other than anecdotal; I don't claim it to be representative of Mac users in general, or Watson users in general.  But I'm quite amazed how quickly people are moving on up!
</p>

Perhaps after the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/macosx2003/">O'Reilly Mac OS X Conference</a>, (Say Hi if you see me there!)  I'll take another look and see how many people have upgraded to Panther after the first week.
