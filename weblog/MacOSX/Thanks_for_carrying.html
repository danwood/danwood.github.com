<h1>Thanks for carrying on in my absence!</h1>


<p>
I got back from a week's vacation (and isolation from any computer), which explains the lack of a bug report on Friday.  But thanks to the many folks who have continued to keep this new tradition alive....

So what are <em>you</em> gonna report this coming Friday?  Answer in the comments....
