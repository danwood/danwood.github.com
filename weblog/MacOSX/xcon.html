<h1>O'Reilly's Mac OS X Conference</h1>


<p>
This year's Mac OS X Conference, put on by O'Reilly Media, is shaping up to be another winner.

Yesterday, I attended Scott Anguish's tutorial on Cocoa Bindings... a subject that I'm still not particularly familiar with since it came on the scene after Watson had been written.   This is great stuff, and it makes it really easy to build a lot of an application's bread-and-butter functionality.

Today, six of us got onstage to do a panel discussion on "How to Start Your Own Software Business."  We talked for 1-1/2 hours on our experiences with starting and running a small company.  I think it was well received.

Tomorrow, Stewart Copeland, famed drummer of The Police (whom I recently had to describe to somebody a bit younger than me as "Sting's old backup band") will be giving a talk.  Maybe he'll do a drum solo for us!
