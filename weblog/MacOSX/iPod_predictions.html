<h1>iPod predictions</h1>


<p>
I've been reading for weeks about an imminent <a href="http://www.forbes.com/personaltech/2004/12/16/cx_ah_1216aapl.html">iPod phone</a>.  OK, fair enough ... I guess it's a cell phone that you can also use for listening to your music.
</p>
<p>
I've <em>also</em> been reading rumors or conjectures of an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB112164093819487841-zvYm7Pa6_6mC_qPZwgEeWhBpeXw_20050817,00.html?mod=blogs">iPod video</a>, along with accompanying videos for sale by the Apple Store.  Considering that iTunes already supports videos, it's not a big stretch.
</p>
<p>
But what I would like to do is go out on a limb and offer one more prediction.  What happens when you combine the notion of the state-of-the-art cell phone (with picture-taking capability standard fare these days) with QuickTime and its <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/technologies/h264/">H.264</a> compression, which Apple touts as being great for mobile phones?
</p>
<p>
A video (ipod) phone, with audio/video recording, not just playback. (And perhaps more far-fetched, transmission &mdash; now we're talking <em>beyond</em> Dick Tracy).
</p>
<p>
Why would they do this?   Because the whole "iPod Phone" and/or "iPod Video" is not that particularly interesting.  The former, as it is currently speculated, is just combining two items into one package, the only real opportunity for synergy is ringtones.  The latter is just an evolutionary step (Heck, it's practically <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/3756421320807387/">been done already</a>), and it's not like a tiny handheld TV is very useful or exciting.  So for this new thing to be interesting, it has to be thinking way outside the box.
</p>
<p>
That's just my prediction. Take it or leave it.
