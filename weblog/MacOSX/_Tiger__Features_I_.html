<h1>"Tiger" Features I'd like to talk about</h1>


<p>
Anybody reading this weblog is probably aware that Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger" due out very soon.  As a developer, I've been able to use the prerelease versions of the OS, but I'm also unable to talk about it.  Now that Apple has released a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/newfeatures/newfeatures.html">big list of new features</a>, I thought I would highlight the items from their list that I would express my enthusiasm for, if I could:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Quartz Composer</dt>
	<dd>Build stunning visualizations that leverage all of Mac OS X&#146;s graphics technologies.</dd>
	<dt>Xcode 2</dt>
	<dd>Experience the second major release of Apple&#146;s groundbreaking developer tools, which bring together ease of use, UNIX power and high-performance development technologies.</dd>
	<dt>Fax Logs and Archives</dt>
	<dd>Keep logs and archives of your faxes.</dd>
	<dt>Spotlight Find</dt>
	<dd>Search all of your documents, images, emails and applications and view the results literally as fast as you can type in search words.</dd>
	<dt>Core Image</dt>
	<dd>Unlock the performance of today&#146;s powerful graphics hardware and enjoy ultra-fast, pixel-accurate image processing.</dd>
	<dt>Safari Inline PDF Viewing</dt>
	<dd>View PDF documents directly in a Safari browser window &#151; no other application required.</dd>
	<dt>Safari RSS Auto Detection</dt>
	<dd>Automatically detect the availability of RSS news feeds for a website so you can easily add them to your list.</dd>
	<dt>Automator</dt>
	<dd>Easily automate complex and repetitive tasks without any programming &#151; just like having a personal robot inside your computer.</dd>
	<dt>Programmer Base 10 math Calculator</dt>
	<dd>Use different systems like base 8 or hexadecimal with the upgraded calculator.</dd>
</dl>



<p>
Of course there are lots of little odds and ends from Apple's list that I will probably find handy.  Notice the big feature that is absent from my list: Dashboard.  I know it's what most users are excited about, but <em>yawn</em>.  (Sorry, Dori!)
