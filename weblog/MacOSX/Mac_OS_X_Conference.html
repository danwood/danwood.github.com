<h1>Mac OS X Conference in Santa Clara</h1>


<p>
Power Users and Developers &mdash; and Mac Music Heads &mdash; should come to the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/macosx2004/">O'Reilly Mac OS X Conference</a> in Santa Clara, CA on October 25th to 28th.
</p>
<p>
I'll be there again this year.  I'm not talking technical this year (since I've been doing more Java than Cocoa for the last few months); instead, I'm on a panel called <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/macosx2004/view/e_sess/5685">How to Run Your Own Software Business</a> along with four notable developers.  We will be exploring a broad range of topics in this expanded, ninety-minute session.  What I contribute will be based upon my personal experiences building Watson and starting Karelia, dealing with suitors for an acquisition, and re-building a company and new product afterwards.  No promises, but I might have some more hints about the new product that Terrence Talbot and I are working on, depending on our progress between now and then.

It looks like the conference will be really cool this year.  <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/macosx2004/view/e_spkr/1914">Stewart Copeland</a> will be there.  Maybe I'll get to meet him, or at least be in the same room with him.  Lots of "<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5652">Cocoa Craftsmen</a>" will be there.  There will be some previews of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">Tiger</a>.  Lots of stuff about Music.  What more could you ask for?
</p>
<p>
Of note is the hefty discount that they have made for Apple Developer Connection members (Hey, isn't it <a href="http://developer.apple.com/membership/">free to become an ADC member</a> at the "online" level?) and employees of Apple Computer.  <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5646">Derrick Story has the scoop</a>.

<p>
If you will be at the conference, please stop me and say "hi"!
