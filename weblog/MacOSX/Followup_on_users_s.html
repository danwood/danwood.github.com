<h1>Followup on users switching to Panther</h1>


<p>Two days after Panther was released, I did some <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/Users_are_quick_to_.html">statistics</a> on Watson launches and found that almost half of Watson's users in a given day had already moved to Panther.</p>

<p>Now it's been almost three weeks since release, and I thought I'd do another check.  (This is a manual process, so it's not easy to check that frequently!)</p>


<ul>
	<li>62.7% on Panther</li>
	<li>36.2% on Jaguar</li>
	<li>1.1% on Puma (10.1)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Interesting!  And hopefully of use to somebody!  :-)</p>
