<h1>Part 3, A few of my favorite apps</h1>


<p>
This is part three of a series... probably the last part unless I can think of some other favorite applications from small, perhaps under-publicized developers.  (There are lots of other great programs out there, but these are ones that I personally tend to use fairly frequently

<h4><a href="http://www.hamrick.com/vsm.html">VueScan</a></h4>
<p>
I have a Canon scanner, which is great except for the fact that the drivers don't work on Panther.  Canon's tech support is MIA.  But VueScan is an application that does that job.  The user interface is a little bit clunky, but is actually works!

<h4><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a></h4>
<p>
I used to use <a href="http://www.a-sharp.com/acta/">ACTA</a> back in the early days of the Mac, and I used to yearn for a Mac OS X program that was as useful.  Finally, after several revisions, OmniOutliner is now my outline processor of choice.  A great way to organize tasks.

<h4><a href="http://www.earthlingsoft.net/UnicodeChecker/">UnicodeChecker</a></h4>
<p>
A great utility to browse and search the thousands of Unicode characters installed on your Mac.  I find the search capability extremely useful.  Even if you aren't a polyglot, it's still handy for finding all sorts of symbols.  Want card symbols?  It will find you &#9824; &#9828; &#9827; &#9831;, etc.  Musical symbols?  How about &#9833; &#9839; &#9836;.  Currency?  How about  &#8362; &#8365; &#8368; &#8369;.

<h4><a href="http://www.grantedsw.com/p-vision/">Peripheral Vision</a></h4>
<p>
A very useful utility to indicate visually when you have added or removed hardware to your system, mounted or unmounted volumes, gained or lost network connections, and so on.  A subtle transparent display (not unlike when you adjust your brightness or volume from the keyboard) appears for a moment on your screen.  Very handy.
