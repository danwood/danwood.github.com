<h1>Hard at work on Sandvox</h1>


<p>
Astute readers may have noticed that we have a <a href="http://www.sandvox.com/">Sandvox</a> development weblog set up at the <a href="http://www.karelia.com/">Karelia</a> site, but not much weblogging going on.  Well, we have had the hood open since <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a>, re-tooling a lot of the internals of Sandvox, One of our big priorities is getting the application back to a state where we can use it to post to the weblog on the site; once we have hit that point, we will start posting more Sandvox information <a href="http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/">there</a>.
</p>
<p>
So what are we working on?  <a href="http://talblog.info/">Terrence</a>, after talking to some helpful Apple engineers at the conference, has streamlined the way that we store <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/coredata.html">data</a> in the document files which will also make it easier for third-party developers to add in their own plug-in types.  I've been focusing on user interface elements (inspired, as usual, by some WWDC sessions) and Webkit editing (which is starting to really rock thanks to helpful Apple engineers and the fact that <a href="http://webkit.opendarwin.org/">WebKit is now open-source</a>).
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, we're continuing to get more great site designs built.  We showcased six designs on the Karelia home page for our announcement a few weeks ago; we have about nine more either finished or in the pipeline.  (Yes, we'll eventually publish a spec for third-party designers to contribute their own.)  Here's one that I just love called "Trippy Bubbles".  (Terrence, BTW, is planning on showcasing another design on <a href="http://talblog.info/">his weblog</a> at some point as well.)

We're still tallying "votes" for favorite design of the six we are showcasing on the Karelia site.  We plan on announcing the winner in the next couple of weeks!
