<h1>Some handy Cocoa source code</h1>


I'm pleased to announce the opening of an <a href="http://cocoa.karelia.com/">open-source repository</a> of some useful Cocoa tidbits used in Watson and some other projects I've been working on.  Unlike the <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/developer/sourcecode/">Omni Frameworks</a> or <a href="http://www.cocoatech.com/index.php?topic=OpenSource">CocoaTech's new frameworks</a>, this is a lot less ambitious and less packaged.  It's really just a weblog (Yes, Virginia, there is an <a href="http://cocoa.karelia.com/index.rss">RSS feed</a>) where each entry is just a snippet of code.  You need to copy and paste into your projects as needed.  The copyright is, I believe, extremely liberal (certainly not infectious like the gnu license), but let me know if you feel it can be improved.
<p />
Why do this?  Just a way of giving back to the Cocoa community that has been so helpful to my efforts in building Watson.

I'll add to this repository occasionally as I run across more generic bits of code, but don't expect a steady stream!  :-)
