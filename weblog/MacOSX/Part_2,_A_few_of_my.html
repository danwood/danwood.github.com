<h1>Part 2, A few of my favorite apps</h1>


<p>
This is part two of a series in which I showcase some of my favorite applications, which all tend to be from small companies.  (Do the big ones really need any publicity from weblogs?)  Check these out and give 'em a spin.

What a great way to keep up with news and weblogs.  I used to have a daily ritual of web sites to visit to see if anything was new, but now I just subscribe to the feeds of my favorite sites and NNW picks up all the new stories for me.  I also use NNW to post stories to my weblog.  This should be on every Mac user's dock.  Congratulations to Brent and team for their 2003 Eddy Award!
 <em>free (NNW Lite) / $40</em>

<p>
A great tool for building up diagrams of all types.  The images it generates are very slick (with shadows and such).  My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be a way to select a group of items to drag from a "stencil" to your document.  <em>$70/$120 (Pro)</em>

<h4><a href="http://www.schubert-it.com/pluginpdf/">PDF Browser Plugin</a></h4>
<p>
I got tired of finding my desktop littered with PDFs that Safari would download for me; most of the time, I want to see PDFs that I get from the Web right in my browser window.  This plug-in allows me to do this.  I wish I could search PDFs from the plug-in, but otherwise it's perfect. <em>free</em>

This is handy for occasional use when we don't get a chance to watch a movie that we've rented at home.   All it needs is 5 to 10 gigs of free space on your hard drive (not always an easy thing to find!) and you can save the DVD for watching later.
