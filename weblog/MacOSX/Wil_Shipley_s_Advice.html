<h1>Wil Shipley's Advice</h1>


<p>Making the rounds in the blog-o-sphere&trade; these days is Wil Shipley's <a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2005/07/student-talk-reloaded-podcast.html">talk and slides</a> of his advice on programming and running a business.  A great (and funny) presentation, it's directed towards students but actually enjoyable by all.  Though I didn't directly have the benefit of Wil's advice when starting Karelia, I have since appreciated his tidbits of wisdom.

I just wanted to put in a plug for the session at last year's O'Reilly Mac OS X Conference (in which Wil, I, and several Mac developers <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/macosx2004/view/e_sess/5685">participated</a>), which is available in <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2004/10/how_to_run_your.html">audio format</a>, courtesy of <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/">Niall Kennedy</a>.  Just in case anybody missed it the first time around.
