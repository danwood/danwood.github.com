<h1>Independent Mac Developers Yahoo Group</h1>


<p>
Brent Simmons (of <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> fame) has started a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/macsb/">Yahoo Mailing List</a> for independent Mac developers -- people who have started a Mac-related business, or who want to.  I've joined the group, since I probably have some insight ... and questions to pose of others too.
</p>
<p>
Its charter/description:
<blockquote>
This group is for small, independent Macintosh developers who want to talk with other developers about the business of Mac development. Questions on pricing, packaging, advertising, e-commerce providers, and so on are on-topic. Note that this list isn't a vehicle for promotion: announcements and press releases are off-topic.
