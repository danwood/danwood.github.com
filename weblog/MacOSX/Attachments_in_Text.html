<h1>Attachments in TextEdit files!</h1>


Here's something kind of cool.  It's possible to embed files of any type inside a TextEdit "rtfd" document, much like you'd put attachments in an e-mail message! <strong></strong>(But see the caveat below!)
<p />
Putting attachments in your file is easy -- just drag a file (or folder) into your document.  (The icon will now be placed in with the text.)  The "receiver" of the document can just drag the icon out to their desktop.
<p />
<strong>The caveat:</strong> Be careful when saving your document with the embedded files.  If you had changed the file externally, and then you save your document containing that file, you will lose your changes!
