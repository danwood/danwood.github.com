<h1>Downloading binary files from Safari -- Beware!</h1>


There's an interesting bug (I sure hope it isn't a feature!) in Safari (Public Beta 2) that people should be aware of -- if you download a binary file, and then for some reason you need to download it again -- perhaps the original download was corrupt and didn't come through properly -- Safari will probably just hand you a cached version of the original download!
<p />
For example, I've found that a certain percentage of downloads of the Watson disk image tend to not make it intact to the other side.  Normally the user response would be "I'ts corrupt; I'll try downloading it again."  But a Safari user has to first empty their cache (from the Safari menu) -- otherwise, the original, corrupt file will reappear instantly on their desktop.
<p />
And yes, I've reported it as a bug with Apple (using their <em>real</em> bug-reporting scheme; not the "bug" icon in Safari that generates a message that is probably read with as much attention as messages to <tt>president@whitehouse&middot;gov</tt> are!)
