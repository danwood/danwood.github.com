<h1>What's a good source to keep up with quality new Mac OS X software?</h1>


<p>
I miss <a href="http://www.chezmark.com/osx/">ChezMark</a>.  This site used to feature a reasonably digestible list of interesting new Mac software each week or two.  But it hasn't been updated for months now.

I want to keep up with the latest cool new software on Mac OS X, but the VersionTracker listings are just too darn big nowadays.  I liked ChezMark because he filtered out a lot of the junk and pointed out interesting new titles.

What do <i>you</i> use to keep informed of new applications?
