<h1>Part 1, A few of my favorite apps</h1>


<p>
Now that we are deep into the holiday season, I thought it would be nice to showcase some of my favorite Mac OS X applications.  Most of these are from small development companies, not unlike Karelia.  Check out these applications and get them for yourselves or as "stocking stuffers" for your friends.

This is a great application when you need to connect to a remote server using SSH.  There are other good FTP client applications like Transmit, but I like RBrowser because it does "scp".  It also has a mechanism where you can double-click a remote document to download it and open it in your text editor of choice; any save to the file is monitored and uploaded immediately.  My only complaint about the app is that its UI is not completely polished for Aqua; it still holds onto many vestiges of its NeXT/Rhapsody heritage.  I rely on RBrowser to maintain www.karelia.com and the other web sites I contribute to. <em>$29/$49</em>

<p>
This is a great utility that monitors your network settings, and if there is a change, it emails you a warning.  This is useful if your laptop is stolen; the police could theoretically use the computer's current IP address to track down its new whereabouts once the computer connects to the Internet again.  Warning: Be sure to install and configure this when you are logged in as an administrator user, otherwise the installation will fail.  <em>$25/$39</em>

This program is vaunted for its ability to edit one document by simultaneous users (over a local network or across the Net).  That feature is amazing.  But it's also a great general-purpose text editor for programming and technical tasks; it features syntax coloring and sectional navigation for a wide variety of formats.  <em>free</em>

A great utility if you are building applications or web pages and you want to give something the "aqua" look.  <em>$15/$50</em>
