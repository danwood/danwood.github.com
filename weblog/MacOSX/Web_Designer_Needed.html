<h1>Web Designer Needed</h1>


<p>
Readers of this weblog and visitors to the Karelia website may have noticed (or not) that not much has changed around here, visually speaking.  The design is kind of plain... which is OK, but maybe it's time for a refresh.  Especially with a new software product coming in the near future, we're going to need the expertise of a web designer to help us out.

<p>
Now a lot of people can know HTML and lay out a page &mdash; heck, even me.  But I'm looking for somebody who's really good at it!  And somebody who has swallowed the CSS "Kool-Aid", who can maybe do something of the caliber of the beautiful designs at <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you're qualified, interested, and available, please drop me a line.
