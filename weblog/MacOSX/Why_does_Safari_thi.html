<h1>Why does Safari think I read Japanese?</h1>


<p>
When Safari requests a Web page, it nicely uses your language preferences that you set in System Preferences, which is what you would expect.  Here's something strange that I stumbled upon &mdash; for some reason, Safari always adds Japanese to the list of languages you accept (in the "Accept-Language" header), whether it is on your list of languages or not.  Why?
