<h1>December MacTech magazine: A Big Improvement!</h1>


<p>
The last few months of MacTech magazine (which I have written for semi-regularly, but not recently) have been kind of dull.  Lots of reviews of gadgets or talking about technologies that are peripheral to the needs of a Mac developer have made recent issues pretty uninteresting to the likes of me.
</p>
<p>
The latest issue, December 2003, is a huge improvement.  Suddenly, it's technical again.  I actually learned <em>a lot</em> in this issue!  There are articles on net networking techniques in Panther; techniques for getting stack traces to track down bugs; Cocoa in Java; APIs for Kiosk Mode.  Even the non-technical articles on driving traffic to your web site and running a small software business had some fresh techniques that I'll find useful.

Kudos to the MacTech team for putting out a substantial issue!  I hope this is a sign of things to come now that Dave Mark is on board as Editor-in-Chief!
