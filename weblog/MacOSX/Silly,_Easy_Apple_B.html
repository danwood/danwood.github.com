<h1>Silly, Easy Apple Bug</h1>


<p>
Today's Apple Bug Report will be an easy one.  <em>Really</em> easy.
</p>
<p>
If you check out 'Document Properties' in TextEdit, notice there is a multi-line field labelled 'Comment:'.  Try typing a bunch of text into that field.  Yes, the text does not wrap!
</p>
<p>
As a developer, I recognize what the fix is immediately, as I myself have forgotten to set multi-line text fields properly.
</p>
</p>
I've filed it as bug <a href="rdar://4270562">4270562</a>.  I'm not suggesting you echo this, by any means!  I'm sure you will find a better one to report!
