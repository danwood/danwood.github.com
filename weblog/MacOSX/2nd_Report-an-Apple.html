<h1>2nd Report-an-Apple-Bug Friday</h1>


<p>
Brent is <a href="http://www.inessential.com/2005/08/18.php">off to an early start</a> on Report-an-Apple-Bug Friday ... so I'd better get on the ball.
</p>
<p>
This week's bug is inspired by the recent <a href="http://www.guidebookgallery.org/articles/interviewwithjohngruber">interview with John Gruber</a>.  He mentions that Lucida Grande, the system font on OSX, needs an italic version.  (Well, technically, an <em>oblique</em> version since it's a sans-serif font.)  <b>What he said!</b>  It's crazy how Safari substitutes Helvetica Oblique for it, too (see below).  I have been lamenting this for years, but it didn't occur to me to submit it as a %#$#$# bug report until now!  So now I have .. bug 4223632.  
</p>
<p>
<blockquote style="font-family:'Lucida Grande'; font-size:1.5em;">
Lucida <b><i>really</i></b> needs a true <i>oblique</i> variant, not <i>Helvetica!</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
So why don't you, dear reader, <a href="https://bugreport.apple.com/">do the same</a>. (<a href="http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/bugrptform.html">Use this</a> if you don't have an Apple Developer Account.)  (Hopefully, John will too.... he may never be Chief UI designer or Chief UI Critic at Apple, but he, like you, <em>can</em> have some impact.

(By the way, I will miss next Friday for this exciting series. If all goes as planned, I will be nowhere near a computer then.  So please carry on without me &mdash; don't let me down &mdash; and I'll resume the following week.  I have some great ideas about difficulty deleting songs in iTunes and photos in iPhoto to report...)
