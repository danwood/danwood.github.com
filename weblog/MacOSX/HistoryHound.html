A former co-worker forwarded me a link to this application, <a href="http://stclairsoft.com/HistoryHound/">HistoryHound</a>.  What a brilliant piece of software.  It's one of those "It's so simple, why didn't I think of it?" kind of applications that I am sure I will be using a lot.  It allows you to search your browser history <em>by content</em>.  And it can keeps an index of any long size, independently of your browser's history.</p>

I just bought a $20 license to the program.  You should too, if you're a Mac user.  You'll like it!
