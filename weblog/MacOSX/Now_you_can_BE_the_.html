<h1>Now you can BE the Engineers (Managers) from Apple!</h1>


<p>
More people who read this weblog are probably aware of the "<a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/engineers.html">Meet the Engineers Behind Tiger</a>" (Really, <em>Managers</em>) feature at Apple than realize that <a href="http://www.onion.com/news/index.php?issue=4116&amp;n=1">there's a new Pope</a> (and the guy they chose was not my <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/2005_04_10_archive.html#a004484">first choice</a>).

Many of you have probably spend most of the last year worshipping these fine men as heroes ... but only now, here is your opportunity to <strong>be</strong> them.
</p>

<p>
<em>How is that possible?</em>  you might ask.  Well, thanks to the magic of iChat, you can change your online looks &mdash; and accompanying personality &mdash; at the drag of a mouse.  Do you want to be French when you look your friends in the eye?  Become Bertrand!  Getting ready for a long hike in the Sierras?  Let Ted Goldstein be your inspiration!  Want to be seen in uber-cool spectacles?  Your friends can envision you as Peter "Graphics" Graffagnino!  Feeling like you need some pep in your life?  Let Scott be your guide! (Plus, it's cheaper than coffee!)
