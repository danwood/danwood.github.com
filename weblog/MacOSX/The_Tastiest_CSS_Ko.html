<h1>The Tastiest CSS Kool-Aid</h1>


<p>
Part of the process of my coming up with the original idea for <a href="http://www.sandvox.com/">Sandvox</a> was seeing what CSS could do.  I read Jeffrey <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Zeldman</a>'s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018/ref=nosim/watson-20">Designing with Web Standards</a>.  And I was inspired by the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>.
</p>
<p>
That was all a while ago, of course.
</p>
<p>
A few days ago, I came across a couple of online presentations that were actually published a year ago, by Douglas Bowman.  They get a lot of the important across in a concise presentation.
</p>
<p>
The first is <a href="http://stopdesign.com/present/2004/ddw-seattle/beauty/">Beautiful Interfaces</a>; the other (more technical) is <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/present/2004/ddw-seattle/tables/">No More Tables</a>.  This is the tastiest CSS Kool aid on the web.
</p>
<p>
The presentations themselves, BTW, are great testimonials.  Take a look at any page of the presentation as HTML source.  Or, drag this link [<a href="javascript:var%20Lt=document.getElementsByTagName('LINK');for(var%20x=0,ss=%5B%5D;Lt%5Bx%5D;x++)%7Bvar%20rel=Lt%5Bx%5D.rel;if(typeof(rel)=='string'&amp;&amp;rel.toLowerCase().indexOf('style')+1)%7Bss%5Bss.length%5D=Lt%5Bx%5D;%7D%7Dfor(var%20x=0;ss%5Bx%5D;x++)%7Bss%5Bx%5D.disabled=!ss%5Bx%5D.disabled;%7D">Toggle CSS</a>] to your bookmarks bar, and click it when viewing a page of the presentation, to see what content there is when you strip away the presentation.
