<h1>Just "Discovered": Safari Bookmarklets (Favelets)</h1>


I have been hearing about "bookmarklets" / "favelets" for a while, but never paid much attention to them.  Last night, I just discovered what they are all about.  It's really cool -- a "bookmark" that does some useful JavaScript.  
<p />
Alas, Safari isn't compatible with a lot of the ones out there, but I'm sure that will improve with time.
<p />
Some sites to check out:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.bookmarklets.com/">bookmarklets.com</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.favelets.com/">favelets.com</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/">Jesse's Bookmarklets Site</a></li>
</ul>
(BTW, the term "bookmarklets" seems to be more common than Favelets -- a Google search on each term shows the clear "winner".)
