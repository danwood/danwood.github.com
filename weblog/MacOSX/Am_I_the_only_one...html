<h1>Am I the only one....</h1>


<p>
So Apple introduced Boot Camp yesterday, and from the Mac-related blogs I've read, it seems that this is this the most exciting news of the year.
</p>
<p>
Am I the only one who <i>isn't</i> excited by this?  If I wanted Windows, I would have bought a Windows box a long time ago.
</p>
<p>
No thanks, I'll stick with Mac OS on my mac.
