<h1>SubEthaEdit 2.0 is out!</h1>


<p><a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a>, the remarkable collaborative/technical text editor, turned 2.0 today.  If you haven't caught on to this amazing software, now is the time to check it out.
</p>
<p>They are now accepting payments for 'commercial' use of this software.  And donations for non-commercial use.  I like to encourage good software by paying for it!   If you also want to see cool independent (e.g. not-from-Apple) applications like this, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/purchase.html">buying some licenses</a>!
