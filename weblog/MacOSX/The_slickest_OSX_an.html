<h1>The slickest OSX animation</h1>


<p>Try this on Panther.  What a cool animation!</p>
<ol>
<li>Open System Preferences.</li>
<li>Choose "Security."</li>
<li>Click "Turn on FileVault..." <em>(Don't worry, we won't actually turn it on.)</em></li>
<li>Authenticate yourself as an administrator, if needed.</li>
<li>A sheet will slide down saying "FileVault requires that you type your password."  Enter your account's password and hit "OK"</li>
</ol>
<p>Did you catch it?  Pretty slick transition to the confirmation dialog, eh?  (Probably no simple way to put that into other applications, is there?  Grrrr....)

At this point, you probably want to hit <b>Cancel</b> unless you really do want to use FileVault.</p>
