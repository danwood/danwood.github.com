<h1>Tools for recovering an unreadable DVD-R?</h1>


<p>
I have a DVD that has my only backup of some family photos that have somehow gotten corrupted by iPhoto.  (The photo files have gotten truncated to zero bytes!)
</p>
<p>
The only problem is that the DVD won't mount on any of my Macs.  The Mac just spits out the DVD after a minute or so.  The DVD <em>looks</em> fine; it's not like there's a big blotch on it....
</p>
<p>
Does anybody know of some tools or techniques for reading a DVD that is corrupt?
