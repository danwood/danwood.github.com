<h1>Looking for CSS Coder, Japanese Web Designers</h1>


<p>
A month ago, I put out a <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/Web_Designer_Needed.html">call for web designers</a>.  Of course, I was being coy; not wanting to talk about <a href="http://www.karelia.com/">Sandvox</a> yet, I mentioned that I was looking for a web designer but didn't say <em>why</em>.
</p>
<p>
Now the cat's out of the bag about what I'm working on for Karelia, and in fact, my blog request paid off well: several of the variants of the <a href="http://www.karelia.com/">Karelia Home Page</a> came from designers who answered the call.
</p>
<p>
I'm still looking for a couple of more niches to be filled, however.  One is a <em>CSS Coder</em> ... we have several designer/coders on-board, but we have a few designs that need to be turned into actual CSS, and not enough CSS experts on-board.  The other need is for a <em>Japanese</em> designer (and hopefully CSS coder) who can create some localized designs that will appeal to my neighbors across the Pacific.  If you have any leads, feel free to send them my way.  Thanks!
