<h1>Congratulations to NetNewsWire and Spring!</h1>


Well, it looks like doing "beyond the browser" Web-connected applications is the hot thing this year.  At the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, it was announced that <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> and <a href="http://www.usercreations.com/spring/">Spring</a> were the first- and second-place winners of their <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/developer/2003/04/24/innovators.html">Mac OS X Innovators Contest</a>.
<p />
(Envious?  Yep ... but Watson was not qualifed to even <em>enter</em> the contest!  Something about that Apple Design Award last year.  But since both applications make use of the <a href="http://curlhandle.sourceforge.net/">CURLHandle</a> framework that I've made availalbe as open source, I can privately share the glory.)
<p />
As it happens, these two applications can be bought along with Watson in a discounted three-way bundle ... but only until the end of April.  <a href="http://www.usercreations.com/spring/3waybundle/">Here's the page with the details</a>.
<p />
Hearty felicitations to the programs' creators, Brent Simmons and Robb Beal!
