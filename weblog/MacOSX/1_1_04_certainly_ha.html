<h1>1/1/04 certainly has new meaning</h1>


<p>
I've grown accustomed over the years to see the date of 1/1/04 as meaning that something on the Macintosh missing a date, or that a clock has been reset.  Now I'm noticing emails in my in-box dated 1/1/04 that are current!  Time to change the mindset..
