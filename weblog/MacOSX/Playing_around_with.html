<h1>Playing around with GarageBand</h1>

I played around with GarageBand, apple's new application (which you must actually <i>pay for</i>), and it's a lot of fun.  I've been waiting for a music sequencer "for the rest of us" for a long time.  I had thought that somebody needed to take up this project, but it wasn't going to be me; it's just not my field of expertise.  Anyhow, I don't have (anymore) a MIDI keyboard to plug into the application, and I know how to play a guitar about as much as I know how to fly a plane, perform brain surgery, or program for MS-Windows.  So I played around with just the built-in riffs. The result is here: <a href="http://www.karelia.com/images/weblog/A%20Total%20Waste%20of%20Time.m4a">A Total Waste of Time</a> (AAC/m4a format &mdash; you may need to option-click on the link to download it!), from the never-to-be-released album, <i>A Total Waste of Disk Space</i>.  Don't expect it to be listenable.  But it was kind of fun to put together this mix of hip-hop rhythms, Nordic strings, and gospel-sounding organ.
