<h1>rsync has problems</h1>


I've given up using rsync on the Mac.  Maybe it's not on my end, but I'm getting all sorts of mystery files with "dirattr" in their name showing up when I upload files from the local development machine to the hosting server.  And mysterious messages of "fopen: No such file or directory", and attempts to upload "rsrc" directories that don't exist.  A Google search doesn't turn up much help, though others are having that problem as well.
