<h1>Deep Thoughts about iTunes + Music Store updates</h1>


<p>
Apple was in the news today with its iTunes updates.  Certainly some interesting developments. My observations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>I'm impressed that Apple has added a bunch of independent music to its offerings.  That is surely in <em>direct</em> response to my <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/2003/04/29#Apple_s_Music_Servi">criticism</a> when the store first launched.  Seriously, I'm glad that the indies are getting exposure, but I find it interesting that of the six independent artists I had mentioned, only one of them (Delerium) has any real presence in the new store.  Still, one can hope that this is too small of a sample to draw any real conclusions.
	</li>
	<li>Since Apple has made a business case to release their own software on Macintosh <em>and Windows</em>, could it be far behind that Apple will revive its capability of <a href="http://nowthis.com/log/1999/05/25.html">deploying Cocoa applications on Windows</a>, so that the rest of the independent software developers can do the same without resorting to completely rewriting their applications, or worse, not bothering to write a Mac version at all?</li>
	<li>The circle is now complete.  With Apple's upcoming <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/oct/16pepsi.html">promotion with Pepsi</a>, it looks like Steve Jobs is helping to sell <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/sodapop/highlights.htm">Sugar Water</a>.  I bet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley">John Scully</a> is having a good laugh today.</li>
</ul>
