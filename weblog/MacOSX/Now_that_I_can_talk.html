<h1>Now that I can talk about Tiger...</h1>


<p>
Recently I listed some of the features from <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/newfeatures/newfeatures.html">Apple's list of new Tiger features</a> that I wanted to talk about.  Well, now I can.  So here are some followups to <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/_Tiger__Features_I_.html">that post</a>.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Quartz Composer</dt>
	<dd>I will probably go into more in the future.  In the meantime, people interested in cool graphics and animation should install the developer tools and run it, it's <tt>/Developer/Applications/Graphics Tools/Quartz Composer</tt>.  Also check out "Core Image Fun House", an application that looks like the major basis for Stone Design's <a href="http://www.stone.com/iMaginator/iMaginator.html">iMagininator</a>. </dd>
	<dt>Xcode 2</dt>
	<dd>I've been using this new version for a while, and it's pretty solid.  I like being able to keep my development contained to one window per project, though I really do miss the major window customization capability that was around in a previous version of XCode, was that Project Builder?</dd>
	<dt>Fax Logs and Archives</dt>
	<dd>Finally!  I don't do faxing a lot, but it's handy to find out whether or not my fax got sent or not!</dd>
	<dt>Spotlight Find</dt>
	<dd>This is gettig a lot of attention, so there's not a lot to say.  'Bout time is all I can say; search within content has been around for a long time, but it just was never integrated into Mac OS X very well until now.</dd>
	<dt>Core Image</dt>
	<dd>I'll have some technical stuff to post about this later.  In any case, this is great technology.  Try the above-mentioned iMaginator or Core Image Fun House for a tour of what you can do.  Starting now, lots of applications are going to have lots more eye candy!</dd>
	<dt>Safari Inline PDF Viewing</dt>
	<dd>Finally!  I had been using a plugin, but this is much better integrated.  You can open the PDF from Safari into Preview with a contextual menu.</dd>
	<dt>Safari RSS Auto Detection</dt>
	<dd>Does this look kind of like a <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/What_if_Safari_dete.html">suggestion I blogged 1-1/2 years ago</a>?  Safari's built-in display of RSS is pretty useless, but it's great integration with NetNewsWire and other RSS applications.  Now you don't have to hunt all over for a little RSS/XML badge on a site; just click on the RSS badge to add it to your feed.  Maybe this will encourage some websites with feeds to actually put the necessary detection markup into their pages.</dd>
	<dt>Automator</dt>
	<dd>I have never been one to swallow the AppleScript Kool-aide (except during and right after a talk by <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/applescript.guru/">Sal Soghoian</a>.  But this makes applescriptability useful for just about anybody.  I've used it quite a bit for just odds and ends, like renaming files, batch-converting images, and so forth.  Great stuff, and it will be even more useful as more application come on-board.</dd>
	<dt>Programmer Base 10 math Calculator</dt>
	<dd>Apple's desscription didn't really do this feature justice.  The built-in Calculator Application now has three personalities: basic, scientific, and programmers.  Lots of useful features on the latter!  Any of them can use RPN if you want.  </dd>
