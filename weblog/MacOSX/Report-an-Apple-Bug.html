<h1>Report-an-Apple-Bug Friday</h1>


<p>
I'm going to try to start a new regular feature for most Fridays.  Others do Friday Cat Blogging, but seeing that I'm terribly allergic to the cute little beasts, I will have to try something else.
</p>
<p>
My idea is <b>Report-an-Apple-Bug Friday</b>, in which I point out an annoying Apple "bug" and encourage all of my readers (Yes, you!) to report that bug (or some other bug you are inspired by) to Apple.   <em>If enough of us squeak, they might fix it.</em></p>
<p>
I've been doing this on my own for a long time.  For instance, I've issued bug reports about:
<ul>
<li>#3418488: Safari, please detect if a page has an RSS feed available <em>(fixed!)</em></li>
<li>#3460492: Please add PDF viewing directly to Safari <em>(fixed!)</em></li>
<li>#3568756: iTunes needs a way to store cover art in external files (I hate having to embed image data into <em>every</em> song file in an album; wastes precious iPod space!)</li>
<li>#4146413: System needs to look <em>inside</em> files to find metadata (see "man 5 magic" at the command line)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
But today, I'm going report, and encourage others to report, the following annoyance.  You insert a CD into iTunes, and the GraceNote/CDDB database has more than one data entry.  You have to choose which one you want -- but the information Apple presents isn't enough to make an informed choice.  Daniel J. Wilson (Membranophonist) wrote <a href="http://blog.wilsonet.com/archives/2005/06/29/cddb-mystery-meat">a good explanation of this</a> &mdash; He even provides a mockup on how to solve it.
</p>
<p>
So here's my suggestion.  If you are a member of Apple Developer Connection, log in <a href="https://bugreport.apple.com/">here</a>.  If you are not, go to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/bugrptform.html">this page</a>.  In your own words, describe the problem and offer a solution.
</p>
<p>
Who knows, we might have an impact. (I just submitted mine; bug #4214525.)
</p>
<p>
Feel free to leave suggestions for future editions of <b>Report-an-Apple-Bug Friday</b> in the comments.
