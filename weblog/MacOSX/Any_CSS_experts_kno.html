<h1>Any CSS experts know why this looks funny in the latest Safari?</h1>


<p>
Ever since the 1.2 update to Safari, this weblog has some formatting problems in its CSS .... the text crams up against the sidebars on the right.  This was OK before.  This behavior is also showing in Mozilla, leading me to believe that Safari is doing what's right, and that there is something in the CSS that was just taking advantage of a "bug" in earlier versions of Safari.  (In IE 5.2/Mac, things are truly bizarre, so who know's what up there?)  Anybody know offhand what's going on?
