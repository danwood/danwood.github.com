<h1>While I'm at it, how about a Quartz Composer Expert?</h1>


<p>
Yesterday's post about CSS designsers has gotten a few responses, thanks readers!
</p>
<p>
I figured I'd also toss out this request as well.  We've integrated Quartz Composer into Sandvox to create graphical titles for pages.  However, I am not a particularly proficient QC user!  So we are looking for somebody we can contract with to create some compositions for us.
</p>
<p>
These are not the kind of "video" compositions that I tend to see a lot ... these are just still images, rendered at time zero.  Technically, a typical composition would be an "Image with String", processed with some cool effects, and all rendered into a "Render in Image" with a published output.
</p>
<p>
If any QC jocks here are interested, please drop me an email at "dwood" at Karelia.  If you have some example compositions you can attach that show off your skills and creativity, that would be ideal.

P.S.  Let's hope the latest Macworld announcement rumors are false, or not what they look like...
