<h1>Our new application will be Tiger-only</h1>


<p>
Well, we have been working on our new application for several months now.  We still have a way to go before it's ready for release, so we recently decided to take the plunge and make this application work on Tiger only, taking advantage of some Tiger-only technologies such as <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/coreimage.html">Core Image</a> and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">Core Data</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, we don't know when Tiger will be available, but by the time we are ready to release our application, Tiger will <em>probably</em> be available.  Hopefully it will have been out for a few weeks to give a significant of the Macosphere to migrate.  (<a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/Followup_on_users_s.html">Experience</a> tells me that users tend to move over pretty quickly to a new release.)
