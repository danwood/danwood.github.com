<h1>Meanwhile, in California....</h1>


<p>
Living in California, U.S.A., I feel like I'm not only living in the country that is the laughing stock of the world these "W" days, but the <i>state</i> that is the laughing stock of the country, with a "Governator," not a real Governor, at the helm.  This is the guy who was elected on the promise of getting rid of the special interests &mdash; who seems to be spending most of his energy collecting big bucks from big corporate interests.
</p>
<p>
Now, we're bracing for a "Special Election" in November which he's forcing down our throats.  Six right-wing, big-business initiatives that couldn't wait until next year, since Arnold would not be allowed to campaign for them if he waited.  So we will have an election that will waste $80 million of taxpayer money.

The first six &mdash; 73 through 78 &mdash; are just disgusting.  <a href="http://www.cadem.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=fvLRK7O3E&b=886771&ct=1166479">One</a> unnecessary measure turns school teachers into scapegoats for problems with our educational system; <a href="http://www.cadem.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=fvLRK7O3E&amp;b=886771&amp;ct=1166323">another</a> guts the recent Proposition 98 for minimal school funding.  (Clearly, Arnold hates teachers!)  A <a href="http://www.prochoicecalifornia.org/s05factsheets/200506141.shtml">"parental notification"</a> measure won't actually do anything to actually <em>reduce</em> abortions.     <a href="http://www.cadem.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=fvLRK7O3E&amp;b=886771&amp;ct=1166489">Another</a> kicks off an early reapportionment, years since the latest census.  <a href="http://www.cadem.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=fvLRK7O3E&amp;b=886771&amp;ct=1166333">Another</a> stifles the political voices of unions.  And then there's the fake prescription drug <a href="http://www.cadem.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=fvLRK7O3E&amp;b=886771&amp;ct=1166495">"discount"</a> measure that doesn't solve any problems &mdash; at least there's a counterproposal (<a href="http://www.allianceforabetterca.org/cheaper_prescription_drugs.asp">Proposition 79</a>) that is competing ... however, this means that big bucks will be spent by the pharmaceutical industry trying to pass theirs/Arnold's version.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by the fact that these deplorable measures are all numbered in the "seventies", I envisioned and executed an image of Arnold as a Disco Dancer from the seventies.  Here is its world premiere!  Feel free to ... uh ... view.
