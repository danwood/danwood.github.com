<h1>Democrats.org: New Website, Bad Security</h1>

Making the web news yesterday was the relaunch of the <a href="http://www.democrats.org/">Democrats.org</a>.  It looks nice, it's well-designed using Web Standards, and it shows a growing party spine.  But what confounds me is that in their secure realms of the site, such as their <a href="https://www.democrats.org/page/contribute">Contribute</a> area or their new <a href="https://www.democrats.org/page/contribute/democracybonds">Democracy Bonds</a> section, their security certificate is messed up.  This means that it's conceivably possible that the site might have been hijacked by, say, the Bushies or the LaRouchies or the BinLadenies, and your donations might be helping to fund <em>them</em>, instead of helping Howard Dean take our country back.

Naturally, I've <a href="http://www.democrats.org/page/petition/techreport">Reported the problem to them</a> but maybe a few more reports filed might help.  I, for one, am not going to get my Democracy Bond until they fix the problem....
