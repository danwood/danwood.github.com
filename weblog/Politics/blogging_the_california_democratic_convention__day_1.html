<h1>Blogging the California Democratic Convention: Day 1</h1>



<p>  
Yesterday was the first day of the 2005 California Democratic  
Convention, and as hoped, I am able to blog a bit, in an attempt to  
share the experience with readers who, like myself only a few months  
ago, are hardly aware of such an event like this taking place.  
</p>  
<!-- more -->  
<p>  
The entire convention goes from Friday mid-afternoon until Sunday  
afternoon at a breakneck pace.  Getting there, I wasn't sure what  
kinds of activities I would be able to participate in. (In spite of a 
 
schedule being made available, <em>what</em> were all these things  
listed?)  Fortunately, my direction was set almost on arrival, when I 
 
found out from fellow delegate John Kang that one of the resolutions  
that I had written [A resolution is a single page set of "whereas"  
and "be it resolved" statements that express a set of principles]  
was going to be discussed in the Resolutions Committee, and as the  
author, I should be on hand to discuss and defend what I wrote.  
</p>  
<p>  
The Resolutions Committee was packed, both with committee members and 
 
(for lack of a better term) audience members.  Fortunately, my  
resolution (which encouraged the party to appropriately frame issues  
in terms of our values, rather than using the "right wing" language 
 
constantly dominating the media; see <a  
href="http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org">Rockridge Institute</a> or 
 
<a href="http://www.frameshopisopen.org">FrameShop</a> for details) 
 
was not passed there due to really being a matter of "organizational 
 
development" so it will be heard by a different group. So not bad for 
 
my first try.  
</p>  
<p>  
Another resolution I wrote concerning equal rights of marriage, which 
 
I learned had been passed around and then co-submitted by seven other 
 
Democratic Clubs and Assembly District committees around the state,  
was marked as being an "affirmation" — essentially, redundant  
so no need to pass it.  So no big deal.  
</p>  
<p>  
I was able to cut out of that committe (which lasted hours and hours  
more; many of the resolutions written by our local group passed!) and 
 
go to the "Computers & Internet" caucus meeting.  Not that  
interesting, though there were some presentations for entries to a  
contest sponsored by Gubernatorial candidate <a  
href="http://westly2006.com">Steve Westly</a>.  The first two  
systems presented for gathering volunteers and keeping track of events 
 
looked somewhat interesting; the third presentation seemed just a  
little suspect, especially when the presenter prounced "blogs" as  
"B-logs"!  Westly himself dropped in and gave a stump speech that  
did not impress me much, and I managed to ask a hard question about  
how would he unite California's "red" and "blue" counties ...  
with not much of a satisfactory answer.    
</p>  
<p>  
After dinner at a nearby restaurant with some folks from back home  
(walking past the stadium where an LA Lakers game was getting  
underway), the convention center had a dozen or so hospitality suites, 
 
sponsored by various candidates for state office and other groups like 
 
SEIU and a teachers' organization.  This part was pretty cheesy, I  
thought.  Still, it was just a chance to walk around and talk to  
people.  (To me, that's what differentiates a <em>conference</em>  
from a <em>convention</em>: A conference can work for you if you are  
totally pasive; a convention is nothing if you don't network.)  I ran 
 
into a <em>lot</em> of people that I got to know last year from my  
political activites; it's heartening to see how many new people have 
 
gotten involved into taking this political party to a better place  
— I heard that 30-35% of the delegates here are new to this.  
</p>  
<p> 
Mostly it's a lot of fun, and I'm learning a lot ... some good news 
and some bad.  The most annoying thing is the followers or crackpot 
Lyndon LaRouche (No, I'm not providing a link!), hanging around like 
mosquitoes at twilight.   
</p> 
<p>  
Saturday will be the main day of the convention.  I expect total  
exhaustion by the end of the day!
