<h1>California Democratic Convention</h1>



<p> 
I haven't posted much about politics since the electoral debacle of 
last year.  I was depressed with the outcome, and frustrated that all 
of the hope that so many of us had back then went up in smoke, and 
frustrated that in spite of the energy of the movement to take our 
country back, we still had a Democratic Presidential 
Candidate/Campaign who was pretty much the typical story.  So I, along 
with a whole bunch of others, decided it was time to try to do 
something about it.  I actually <em>joined</em> the Democratic Party 
(I had been independent) and got myself elected to being one of the 
delegates representing my <a 
href="http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a16/about.htm">assembly
district</a> here in California.   And this weekend, I will be going 
to the  
<a

State Democratic Convention</a>.

A lot of people who go to these things are entrenched old-timers and 
are happy to be members of this club, even if it means being on the 
losing team all the time. But a bunch of people like me are new at all 
this, and have to figure out what the heck is going on, but are also 
there to ask some hard questions and challenge the way things are 
currently run in the "Wobblycrats" party. 
</p> 
<p> 
If I have computer access, I will blog a bit about what's going on 
here.  This process is part of the way that citizens can have some say 
in the way this country is run, and I feel that so far, it's been 
quite an "insider's club."  (Most people I talk to haven't even 
heard of all the state conventions, the assembly districts, the 
delgates, etc., and it took a lot of digging to figure out what it's 
all about.)  Just as weblogs had a big impact on last year's 
elections, I think they can continue to have an impact by making 
transparent more aspects of our government ... seeing where the party 
platforms and positions come from, where the candidates get their 
start, and so forth.

If anybody has any questions about what the convention is about  or 
what happens there, please feel free to leave them in the comments.  
(Please, no flames from Republicans &mdash; you are having your turn 
in office now, so lighten up.)
