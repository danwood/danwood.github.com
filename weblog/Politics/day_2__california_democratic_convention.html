<h1>Day 2, California Democratic Convention</h1>



<p>  
Here's a smaller report on day 2 of the California Democratic  
Convention.

Most of the day's programs (aside from a few formal  
acclamation "elections" of party officials, <em>yawn</em>) on  
Saturday's program was a series of "Town Hall" events that were  
anything but.  For the most part, they were a series of speeches (many 
 
of them by candidates for state office who used the opportunity to  
give a stump speech) with no interaction with the audience.  Sorry  
guys, put putting your lineup in director's chairs instead of sitting 
 
behind a curtain-lined table does not make it a town hall.  I did find 
 
the session on Social Security somewhat interesting because the  
speakers were <em>not</em> candidates for anything, and were therefore 
 
there to talk about the issues at hand.  I actually learned a lot  
about what the real story behind the funding of the program is, how  
changing the investment backing from Government Bonds to roll-the-dice 
 
stock market funds wouldn't do anything to change the  
in-<i>vs</i>-out funding situation, etc.

Concurrent with the above was a small setup of booths, much like the  
show floor at a typical conference.  A hodge-podge of booths, really: 
 
some purely selling swag and souveniers, some representing particular 
 
groups and interests (teachers, unions, Native Americans, etc.), some 
 
for passing out literature for upcoming candidates, some activism and 
 
advocacy groups,and so forth.    
</p>  
<p>  
As a side note, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the number of  
over-the-top "political convention geeks" was very low.  You know  
the type: rainbow suspenders with every inch covered with buttons;  
gigantic sparkly red-white-and-blue hats, etc.  Very few of those.   
Mostly it's just a cross section of real California residents mulling 
 
around and networking.

The highlight of the day was, beyond a doubt, the banquet speech given 
 
by former Presidential Candidate, now head of the Democratic Party,  
Howard Dean.    Let's just say it was well received, and I think  
quite a breath of fresh air as far as the Democratic Party is  
concerned.  It wasn't a campaign speech; it was about what values and 
 
rights we have as Americans.  Instead of the usual policy-wonk stuff  
that just doesn't resonate with the average American, this was all  
about values.  It was clear that he had been heeding the advice of  
George Lakoff's book <a

Think of an Elephant</cite></a>; those of us there who are familiar  
with Lakoff's work were quite happy to see that Dean, and perhaps the 
 
Democratic Party as a whole eventually, gets it.  People can't be  
persuaded from the mind only, but also from the heart.  I highly  
suggest interested folks to check out the <a  
href="http://cadem.org/webcast/">webcast</a> of the speech if/when  
it comes online.

<p>  
Sunday, the last day of the convention, is a short day.  I may have a 
 
chance to report on it, or possibly not; we'll see.
