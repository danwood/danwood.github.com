<h1>Christopher Walken?</h1>

<p>
What the heck?
</p>
<p><b>Update:</b></p>
<p>
OK, by the time you read this, this is all over the blogosphere and probably the news.  Since it seems to be such a new development, I looked on Technorati to see how long it's been discussed.  The earliest mention of it I could find was <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2004580002-2005360003,00.html">this post</a>.  (Note that it's pointing to <a href="http://www.enigmasystems.net/walken/">his web page at his hosting site</a>, not at the walken2008.com domain.)
</p>
<p>
What's <i>really</i> cool is that what also came out recently &mdash; dated today, in fact &mdash; is the news that Walken wants to <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2004580002-2005360003,00.html">play a zombie</a>.
</p>
<p>
Or, maybe it's the same story...
