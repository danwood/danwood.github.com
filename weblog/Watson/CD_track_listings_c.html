<h1>CD track listings coming soon to Amazon tool</h1>


Amazon.com has recently made the list of tracks on a CD available to their Web Services clients, so Watson will be picking this up very soon.  Expect a minor update shortly that will show CD tracks in the detail drawer.  (Alas, no music samples!)
