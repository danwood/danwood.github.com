<h1>Pricegrabber tool fixed to use live category feed</h1>


<p>
Watson's PriceGrabber tool got an update today to deal with the problem of the tool always falling behind when <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com/">Pricegrabber.com</a> would change their product categorizations.
</p>
<p>
Until now, I've just made sure that a new release comes out every so often to keep up with the changes at their site.  But now, the nice folks at PriceGrabber have created a live 'feed' of their categories; all Watson has to do now is to get that file to have a fresh version of their categories.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the categorization isn't changing <em>that</em> fast.  So the hierarchy is cached for a week.
</p>
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!
