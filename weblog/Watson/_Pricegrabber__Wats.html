<h1>'Pricegrabber' Watson tool to be serviced</h1>

<p>
For those who use Watson's 'Pricegrabber' tool: You may experience some strange behaviors today with the Music and Movies categories.  We will be 'servicing' the tool today, and the lag between the server and client updates may cause some strange behaviors.
</p>
<p>
Here's what's happening.  Internally, the IDs representing music's and movie's subcategories are not handled by Pricegrabber.com the same way the rest of the subcategories are handled.  As Pricegrabber has grown, subcategories from other top-level categories have encroached on the Movies and Music territory.
</p>
<p>
Today, the folks at PriceGrabber will be fixing things on their end -- and then we'll try to get the Watson tool caught up with these changes as soon as possible.  But in between the time that things change on PriceGrabber's side and the new version of the Watson tool gets 'streamed' out, things may be a bit strange.
</p>
<p>
If you will be using the PriceGrabber tool today or tomorrow, be sure to re-launch Watson every so often (or pay attention to this weblog) to be notified of the update.
