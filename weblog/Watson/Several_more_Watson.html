<h1>Several more Watson tools get updated</h1>


Today, a new batch of minor updates to Watson tools, too late to make it into the recent 1.7.3 release.  

<ul>
	<li>Epicurious - Fixed a bug where web pages wouldn't be opened in the background, even if the user had specified that preference</li>
	<li>Movies - If you specify a large city (e.g. "San Francisco, CA") in the settings drawer, you will now be notified that you need to enter a Zip code instead, so it can locate your exact neighborhood.</li>
	<li>Pricegrabber - Installed an updated database</li>
	<li>TV Listings - a few more tweaks to yesterday's unanticipated major update:
			<ul>
			<li> Searching should now work consistently better</li>
			<li> Data should now be copied to iCal and EyeTV correctly</li>
			<li> Removed formatting problems for certain grid items</li>
			<li> Added <small>[cc]</small> to grid listings that specify it</li>
		</ul> 
	</li>
</ul>
