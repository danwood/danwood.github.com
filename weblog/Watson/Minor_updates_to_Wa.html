<h1>Minor updates to Watson posted today</h1>


<p>
Today, a few updates to Watson streamed out:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>eBay: fixed a problem where "featured items" were showing instead of all items</li>
	<li>Image Search:  Fixed a problem where Ditto images were not being found</li>
	<li>Packages: Removed Airborne (now that they have merged with DHL) and updated the tool to conform with their new format</li>
</ul>
