<h1>This is a beginning, not an end</h1>


<p>
I've been getting a lot of comments from Watson users over the last 24 hours.  Most are messages of congratulations and of looking forward to the what the new version will bring.
</p>
<p>
But others ... well, maybe people weren't really reading the FAQ completely.  Some people are reacting as if this is the end of Watson and all that it does.  <b>That couldn't be more untrue.</b>  There is a screenshot of the program in development (inlined below) at the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/KitchenSink">weblog</a> I pointed to yesterday. No, this isn't a mock-up, this is a real screenshot of real, working code.  True, it has not been announced as a product yet, but it is very much real.  And Mac users should agree that it looks pretty Mac-like, and pretty Watson-like.  And it's built in a technology that is inherently cross-platform, so it would take <em>extra work</em> to not have this function on the Mac!
</p>
<p>
So please, don't think of this as the End of Watson.  Watson is just entering a chrysalis for a transformation.
