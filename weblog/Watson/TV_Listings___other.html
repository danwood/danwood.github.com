<h1>TV Listings & other Watson tool updates</h1>


Many (but not all) Watson users have been experiencing problems with the TV Listings tool over the last couple of weeks.   I finally have an idea what has been happening, and can now resolve the issue.
<p />
When Watson (or any browser) accesses a web site, there may be more than one server computer on the receiving end, even though it appears that there is just one.  This is a technique called "load balancing".  Apparently, the folks at TVGuide.com have been updating their HTML --  something not uncommon, and a program that 'scrapes' sites has to deal with it.  But in this case, the HTML has changed on <i>some</i> of their servers, not all of them.
<p />
So today's fix (to 1.7.2.2) accomodates both "old" and "new" HTML, and everybody should be happy now.  Unless, of course, there is yet another variation in the mix that I haven't found.  <i>Many thanks to the Watson users who helped diagnose and test the fix!</i>
