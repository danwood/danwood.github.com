<h1>eBay Watson tool updated today; Minor App update coming soon</h1>


Today, the eBay tool got update to play catch-up with the Web site.
<p>
And .. get ready for a (minor) update to the application, some time in the next few days.  Nothing particularly newsworthy in this update, but for those who are lucky enough to have been seeded with Panther, this version is more or less compatible with it, and even <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/2003/06/25#Panther_and_Apple_s">takes advantage of one of Panther's new features</a>.
