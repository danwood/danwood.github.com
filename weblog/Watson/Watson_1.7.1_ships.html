<h1>Watson 1.7.1 ships</h1>


A week after Watson 1.7 shipped, now 1.7.1 is out the door.  This is primarily a maintenance update, fixing a couple of problems that couldn't be resolved with just tool updates (which don't require a new version of the application to be downloaded).
<p />
We added some additional options for working with the new "combo boxes" that are used for search inputs across the suite of tools.  Many users had requested the ability to clear their search histories; there is now a menu  (<font face="Lucida Grande">Watson &#9655; Clear Searches</font>) to do just that.  There are also a couple of preferences for the combo boxes: how many items to remember, and whether or not to auto-complete as you type.
<p />
And based on several requests to "bring back" the ability to drag the preview image from the Epicurious tool onto your desktop or other programs (which had never been an advertised feature), dragging is back.  But wait, there's more -- the preview images from Movies and PriceGrabber as well.  (The feature was already available on the Amazon.com tool.)
<p />
You can drag the images to your desktop or other programs that accept graphics, like Preview or <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/2003/04/29#Use_Watson_s_Amazon">iTunes</a>.  You can also drag them into <a href="http://www.usercreations.com/spring/">Spring</a> and create "objects."  (Spring Version 1.3 or greater is required for this; it's currently in public beta.)  So now you can have recipe objects, movie objects, and objects representing products from either Amazon.com or PriceGrabber.com.  What a hoot!
