<h1>Epicurious, Packages updated</h1>


<p>The Epicurious tool got an update today to fix some problems dealing with multiple result sets.</p>
<p>The Packages tool got an update in version number only ... apparently there were a significant number of earlier versions floating around there with an incorrect version number (1.7.6), so to deal with this problem, I've created an update which will leap-frog that incorrect version number, to 1.7.6.1.
