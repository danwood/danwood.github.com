<h1>TV Listings updated, but with reduced functionality</h1>


<p>
I've just posted an update to the TV listings tool, to version 1.7.5.7.  TV Guide has once again changed their Web site in a major way.  Unfortunately, some of information that was once displayed on the Web site is now part of a Macromedia Flash presentation.  That makes the Web site a lot nicer (as long as you have the ability to view Flash) but not great for Watson.  So although Watson can still show the grid, we've unfortunately lost the ability to show details about each show, add it to the Calendar, etc.

Going forward, TVGuide.com is clearly not going to be an ideal data source as Watson moves forward in its <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/KitchenSink/20040625">new incarnation</a> from Sun.
