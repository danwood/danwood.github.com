<h1>Watson 1.7.5</h1>


<p>
There's a new version of Watson available; this is a last-minute bugfix update to deal with some problems with the Movies tool.  Here's the full change summary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug fixed: If no "Home Base" URL is specified in the preferences, the tools are now useable again.
</li>
<li>Bug fixed that caused Movies tool (and possibly others) to parse HTML incorrectly and thus not function
</li>
<li>Image Search: Minor updates to parsing source pages
</li>
<li>VersionTracker: Restored missing clipboard copy functionality
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On another note, a few users have reported crashes while using the Weather tool from Panther, this appears to be related to a problem deep down in the bowels of Apple's text handling system.  We are working to isolate the problem and report it to Apple.
