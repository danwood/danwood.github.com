<h1>Amusing misbehavior of drawers using Expos&eacute;</h1>

A Watson user pointed out this interesting bug, which will work in Watson or any other program with "drawers."  While a drawer is opening, hit F9 to invoke expos&eacute;.  When you get back to the Watson window, chances are very good that the position of the drawer will be positioned all wrong, relative to the window.
