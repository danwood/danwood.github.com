<h1>How to delete your saved search terms</h1>


Since the 1.7 version of Watson came out last week, I've been deluged with e-mails (OK, maybe a dozen) asking how to delete the saved search terms that show up in the combo boxes across the suite of Watson tools.
<p />
A great idea for a future version of Watson to provide this functionality!  But if you want to clear out your saved searches <em>now</em>, there's a slightly more elegant solution than throwing away your entire prefs file (which is a baby-with-the-bath-water approach).
<p />
Check out Watson's <a href="http://www.karelia.com/watson/grabbag/">Grab Bag</a> page for an AppleScript that will delete the saved searches for you (after quitting Watson).
