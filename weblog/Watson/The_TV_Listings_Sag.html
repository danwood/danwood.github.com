<h1>The TV Listings Saga Continues</h1>


Today, it looks like tvguide.com unveiled a major revamp to their Web site ... but as a result, Watson had to play catch-up again.
<p />
Alas, this change in their site affected some functionality of the Watson tool.  Now, users need to establish a free account on TVGuide.com, as if they were viewing the listings through their web browser.  (Of course, the listings look like $#$#$#%$#@$ with Safari, but OK on Internet Explorer.  But I digress.)
<p />
Then, in the Watson TV Listings tool, just set the e-mail address you used with TVGuide.com.  Functionality is restored!
<p />
(Actually, the VCR Plus code listing had to go, but now we get to see whether a show is Closed-Captioned by a [CC] in the detail window.)
