<h1>Contributed "iMedia" Watson tool: strong reactions</h1>


A couple of days, ago, Randy Saldinger submitted <a href="http://www.mothersruin.com/software/iMedia/">iMedia</a>, a Watson tool that browses "independent media" sources -- news, columns, and audio programs.  Since making it available for download directly from Watson (from the "Install More Tools..." menu), I've come across some rather strong e-mails, both in favor of, and against the tool.

Love it or hate the tool, all I can say is that Free Speech is a truly wonderful thing!
