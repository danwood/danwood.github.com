<h1>A couple more tools updated</h1>


<p>
In what is shaping up to be a weekly event, here are a couple more Watson updates to mention:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>eBay: they are still fiddling with their pages, and Watson must catch up again.</li>
	<li>Phone: Fixes to business listings to catch up with changes on both Web sources.</li>
</ul><p>
