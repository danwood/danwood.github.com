<h1>Tools Updated Today</h1>


A few tools are being updated today:
<ul>
	<li>Amazon (1.6.2.1) -- CD track listings; a few new attributes in the details list; changing store does not clear the search field.</li>

	<li>PriceGrabber (1.6.2.2) -- Updated to latest product hierarchy (including cross-references); fixed bug that prevented showing more than 25 items in the list generated from the third column; emphasized digital photography since it was hard to find</li>

</ul>
