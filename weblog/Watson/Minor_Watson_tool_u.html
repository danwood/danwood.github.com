<h1>Minor Watson tool updates today</h1>


For those who like to keep up with the nuances of Watson updates, there were a couple of tool fixes posted today.
<ul>
<li>Translation - a fix to the FreeTranslation parser</li>
<li>Movies -- several fixes to handle indie movies that don't have all the information available; those listings were causing HTML junk to show in the movie summary field.  Also, improved the graying-out logic for movies not yet released (in the by-Movie view).  And a double-click on a theater name now opens up the moviefone.com page showing a map to the theater.
</ul>
Also, updated the slashdot plugin for SiteSearch to use their RSS feed, this doesn't require a new version of the tool.  (Thanks, <a href="http://pudge.net/">pudge</a>!)
