<h1>Weather problems updated again</h1>


Today, Watson got another update to the Weather tool, in order to deal with problems viewing doppler radar in many parts of the U.S.
<p />
Unfortunately, I am noticing a lot of database connectivity problems when I try and access weather.gov.  It's very intermittent.  Perhaps it's because of this PC worm going around -- a lot of their servers seem to be running on PCs.  All I can suggest for users is that they choose their location from the Settings drawer again if the first load doesn't work.
<p />
Also updated was the eBay tool, to catch up with a change in formatting that hid the prices from Watson.

Hopefully nothing major crops up next week with Watson while I'm on vacation!  <tt>:-)</tt>
