<h1>The Future of Watson</h1>


<p>
Some of you may have noticed that things have been pretty quiet in Watson-land, and that no major new version of Watson has been released for quite a long time.  Now, I'm able to tell you why, and what's coming.
</p>

<p>
The short version of the story is that a large company has licensed the Watson Technology from Karelia, and I have been working with them for several months now, working on what is essentially a new version of Watson.

(Please read the full description of the transition on Watson's <a href="http://www.karelia.com/watson/watsonFAQ.html">Product FAQ page</a>.)
</p>

<p>
This week at the Java One conference, this company is giving a sneak peek of this new program, so I can finally talk about the work I've been doing, and discuss the future directions for Watson. (If you're attending Java One or WWDC, you can stop by at the Java pavilion, where I'll be helping with the demos on Tuesday PM and Wednesday.)

<p>
The Mac-only version of Watson is going to be slowly phased out, and we can hope that soon this company will have something comparable to replace it with.  Watson WILL be fully supported and updated during this time period.   I'm very happy with how the new version is coming along; I think that current Watson users will not be disappointed with how it looks and performs on the Mac.    If you are curious about its progress, and hopefully some screenshots, you may want to check in on <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/KitchenSink">this weblog</a>.
