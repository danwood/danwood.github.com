<h1>Watson's 'Weather' tool updated; new third-party 'Astronomy' tool</h1>


<p>
Today, the Weather tool in Watson was updated to 1.7.5.2 to catch up with a few changes on a few weather sites around the country.

<p>
Additionally, a new third-party tool, 'Astronomy', was released today by Wesley Ray Hall.  It displays a library of the 'Astronomy Picture of the Day' along with facts about each picture.  Download it from 'Install More Tools...' under the Watson menu.
