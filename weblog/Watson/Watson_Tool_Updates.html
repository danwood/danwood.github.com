<h1>Watson Tool Updates du jour</h1>


<p>
A few Watson tool updates got streamed out today:
</p>
<dl>
	<dd>Phone Listings</dd><dt>to 1.7.3.1, caught up with web site changes that were breaking business searches in the US</dt>
	<dd>TV Listings</dd><dt>to 1.7.3.7, this was actually a bugfix (rather than responding to a server change) that was causing strange behavior when changing your tvguide.com profile while running Watson.</dt>
</dl>
<p>
Also, the third-party "iMedia" tool got a minor update today as well.
