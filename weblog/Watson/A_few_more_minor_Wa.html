<h1>A few more minor Watson updates for your enjoyment</h1>


<p>
Today, a few more tools got updates.  As usual, here is the run-down for those who want details, details, details.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>eBay, to 1.7.5.2.  Fixed a problem with search-by-seller-ID when there were small result sets.  Unfortunately had to retire searching completed auctions; this now requires registration and signing in on the eBay web site.</li>
	<li>Phone Listings, to 1.7.5.4: Fixed a problem with Canadian phone listings; fixed a problem where the choice of residential/business/toll-free numbers was not being saved to preferences.</li>
	<li>TV Listings, to 1.7.5.2: Fixed a problem where bogus information was showing up in the lower corner of the window.  Also turned the email address entry field to a combo box to make it easier to switch accounts if needed.</li>
</ul>
