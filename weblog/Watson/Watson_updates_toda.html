<h1>Watson updates today (whew!)</h1>


<p>
After a weeks' vacation, I finally got to a few updates to Watson.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Epicurious, to version 1.7.5.1.  They changed their site significantly.  This update should bring back pretty much all the original functionality of the tool.  (There may still be a few glitches.)</li>
	<li>TV, to version 1.7.5.8.  I've added in the ability to add iCal and EyeTV events, based on the limited information available in the grid.  Since it can't be determined just from the grid, any program that is not followed by another program on the grid causes a warning to be shown that the entire time might not be captured.  It's not ideal, but at least it's something.</li>
	<li>eBay, to 1.7.5.9.5.  Fix a problem with search by seller, where the description wasn't showing up.</li>
</ul>
