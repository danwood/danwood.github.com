<h1>'Phone' Tool updated for Canadian businesses</h1>


<p>
Today, Watson's 'Phone' tool got updated to catch up with changes in yellowpages.ca's business telephone listings.  There may be more updates to come -- it appears that the ability to get more than one "page" of information (accessed via the <img src="http://www.karelia.com/images/weblog/more.png" /> green arrow at the bottom of a Watson window) is broken on their web site.
