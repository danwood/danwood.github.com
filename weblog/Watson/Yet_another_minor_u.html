<h1>Yet another minor update to Watson</h1>


<p>Today, a few Watson tools got updated.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>eBay: The funny thing is that I ran out of single-digit minor update numbers on the eBay tool.  (Generally the format has been the first three numbers representing the application version, like 1.7.5, with the fourth number being a minor tool update.  But we're not ready for 1.7.6 yet &mdash; still waiting for some help from Apple to fix an outstanding bug &mdash; so what comes after 1.7.5.9?  It can't be 1.7.5.10 because mathematically, that's treated as 1.7510 = 1.7.5.1 which is less than 1.759.  So instead it's 1.7.5.9.1 which will work, though it's a bit long-winded.</li>
	<li>Phone listings: some fixes to US business & residential searches</li>
	<li>Movies: Fixed a bug where dates in the popup weren't passed to the server in "Theaters" view.  Also improved the error message on an elusive problem where Real media files are being served instead of QuickTime.  I haven't figured out the cause, but at least the error message is more accurate.</li>
	<li>Weather: Removed some annoying alerts that would pop up when there were server connectivity problems.</li>
</ul>
