<h1>A Nice Watson-ish Icon</h1>


Just for fun (because I think the icon is so nice; <a href="http://www.mikesicons.com/">Michael Matas</a> does some great work!), I thought I'd share the icon for an upcoming freeware application, in development....<br><center><img src="http://www.karelia.com/images/weblog/NewAppIcon.png"></center>

If  you already have Watson, this won't be a big deal; it will just be a subset of the existing tools.
<p />
And no, I don't have a scheduled release date.  Please, no breath-holding.  It's just a pretty icon!
