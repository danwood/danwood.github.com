<h1>Watson Tweak Day</h1>


<p>
Some minor Watson updates today:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>TV Listings to 1.7.4.2, to handle locations where tvguide provides three hours of listings, not just two hours.  (No, I have no idea why or how to make your provider show three hours' worth!)</li>
	<li>Stocks to 1.7.4.1, to fix a URL encoding issue that prevented CBS Marketwatch news stories from being able to open</li>
	<li>Phone to 1.7.4.1, to fix some issues with German phone numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, the LyricTracker module got an update streamed out to fix a parsing issue.  (No version increment.)
