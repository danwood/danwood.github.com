<h1>Major and Minor Watson Tool Updates</h1>


<p>
Today, two Watson tools were updated ... one a major update and the other a minor one.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <b>Movies</b> tool had to be significantly rebuilt, as MovieFone.com &mdash; now part of AOL &mdash; changed their formatting.  </li>
	<li>The <b>Translation</b> tool was tweaked to fix issues with Babelfish and Freetranslation.</li>
</ul>
