<h1>Does anybody miss Sherlock 2?</h1>


The story about Sherlock 3 vs. Watson has been beaten to death<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/09/26/dev_osx.html">*</a>.  But what about good old Sherlock 2 (and 1, for that matter?)  Watson was originally conceived as a companion to Sherlock -- because Sherlock didn't go far enough.  But still, the original Sherlock had some useful features.  There are dozens, if not <em>hundreds</em> of Sherlock 2 plug-ins available for download from various Web sites, but Apple effectively abandoned them.
<p />
There's an interesting project that's part of Mozilla called <a href="http://mycroft.mozdev.org/">Mycroft</a> that resurrects the Sherlock 2 plug-in as a way of conveniently searching a site.
<p />
Hmm, this gives me some ideas....
