<h1>"Watson" Category Discontinued</h1>


<p>
This applies only to people reading the "Watson" category of this weblog.  Since Watson is no longer a sold/supported product, I am no longer going to be updating this thread.  Occasional mentions of Watson (including <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/WatsonStatus.html">this new one</a>) will continue in the "MacOSX" category, which can be read as part of the general Weblog page or feed, or in its own <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX">Web page</a> or <a href="http://rss.karelia.com/MacOSX">RSS feed</a>.
