<h1>Updates to Movies, Phone, Weather today</h1>


A few more Watson tool updates were streamed out today; here's the list.
<ul>
	<li>Movies (to 1.7.2.1)- Fix some problems parsing the rating and time of the movie in its description</li>
	<li>Phone (to 1.7.2.1) - A multitude of fixes; some business lookups were incorrectly returning residential listings, and some wrangling was necessary to restore European listings</li>
	<li>Weather (to 1.7.2.2)- A fix to get some cities working again; also updated the list of international weather station locations.</li>
</ul>
