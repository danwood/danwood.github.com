<h1>Weather and Packages: fixes to the fixes</h1>


<p>
A couple more Watson updates today:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Packages, to 1.7.5.2.  Airborne has merged with DHL, so a couple of weeks ago, we removed Airborne from the list of carriers.  The trouble is, those packages couldn't be deleted anymore!  So we've put it back in, even though Airborne packages can no longer be tracked.  Aren't corporate mergers annoying?</li>
	<li>Weather, to 1.7.5.4.  Last week's fix to restore forecast icons to certain locations wound up breaking other locations.  (The Weather tool is tricky to maintain, because it's not just connecting to one server, but many different servers across the country, some running Windows and some running Unix, each one slightly different than the others!)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hopefully this will help!
