<h1>XCode UI annoyances</h1>


<p>
I'll be happy to report this as a "bug" to Apple, but I thought I'd see if anybody felt that I'm going about this all wrong.
</p>
<p>
The problem has to do with XCode.  I like to use the keyboard to navigate quickly, but here's something I haven't figured out how to work around.
</p>
<p>
Annoyance #1, <b>Viewing an arbitrary file</b>: I can either root around in the source tree with the mouse (scrolling, disclosing groups, etc.) and eventually find the file I want, or I can choose the project view from the mouse (I use all-in-one layout),  scroll up and click the tree's root (again with the mouse), click in the search field in the right corner of the toolbar, start typing the file name, and then click on the file from the list below to make its contents appear in the editor below.  It would be nice to be able to select and open an arbitrary file with a keyboard command, typing a few letters of the file name, maybe an arrow key or two, and return.  
</p>
<p>
Annoyance #2, <b>Accessing code in another open project</b>: I usually have two projects I have open all the time -- the application and its main framework.  From the application project, I can command-double-click on a method to bring up its implementation if the method is in the same project, but if the implementation is in the framework project, it brings up its declaration in the .h file.  Fine, but then I can't do command-option-up-arrow to get to the corresponding .m file because it's not in that project.  So then I have to click on the other project, and find the desired file manually (see above).
</p>

Anybody have any suggested workarounds? Other annoyances about navigating in XCode?  Please leave them in the comments....
