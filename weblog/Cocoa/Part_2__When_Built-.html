<h1>A Great Cocoa supplement </h1>


<p>
As most modern developers know, a great way to save time when building an application is to stand on the shoulders of others, by making use of open-source/free software that is all around.  You see if somebody else has already solved your problems in a general way, and incorporate their software libraries into your application.  Ideally, you give a little back to the community and perhaps contribute something of your own for others to use.

I wanted to highlight a great Cocoa UI addition &mdash; or rather, <em>replacement</em> &mdash; that we are using in our forthcoming application.  It's <a href="http://www.brockerhoff.net/src/rbs.html">RBSplitView</a>, a replacement for the not-keeping-up-with-the-times NSSplitView class.  Its developer, <a href="http://www.brockerhoff.net/">Rainer</a>, has been <em>extremely</em> helpful by making this class available, and responding to feature requests to enable developers to make more "modern" software.  If you want a better split view, check this class out!
