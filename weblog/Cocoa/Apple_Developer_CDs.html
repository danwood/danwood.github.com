<h1>Apple Developer CDs & DVDs: Useless anachronisms</h1>


<p>
One "benefit" to being in the Apple developer program is their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/membership/mailing.html">monthly mailings</a> of CDs (and now, quarterly, DVDs).  Back in the old days (Anybody remember <a href="http://www.mackido.com/CodeNames/DeveloperCDs.html">Phil and Dave's Excellent CD</a> and all the other silly titles?) the CDs were incredibly useful, chocked full of sample code, SDKs, online documentation, system software, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
Today, these CDs/DVDs are totally useless.  Every few months, I open one up and check out the contents.  And you know, there's nothing there that I can't download from the Internet &mdash; and probably get a newer version, too.  And I laugh when I get a "seed" version of whatever OS is currently in development; by the time it gets to me, I've already downloaded, burned, and installed a much newer version!
</p>
<p>
So part of my fees to the developer program goes to fund this completely wasteful endeavor that should have been phased out in the late nineties.  So thirteen giant non-recyclable Tyvek envelopes get thrown away, along with twelve CDs and four quarterly DVDs that sit on my shelf and accumulate dust until I get sick of seeing them, too.

Does anybody with Internet access actually find these CDs useful?
