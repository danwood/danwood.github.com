<h1>JSON and Sandvox Pagelets</h1>


<p>
Yesterday <a href="http://weblog.scifihifi.com/">Buzz</a> introduced me to <a href="http://www.crockford.com/JSON/">JSON</a>, a cool way for Javascript to load remote data.</p>
<p>
This technology, it turns out, will come in handy for <a href="http://www.karelia.com/innovative_pagelets_provide.html">Sandvox pagelets</a>, because websites can load up interesting live data from a third-party information source without needing to go through Karelia's server as an intermediary (as our RSS pagelet does, using <a href="http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/">MagpieRSS</a> to convert RSS/Atom to HTML).
</p>
<p>
I've recently put together a cool new pagelet which uses JSON; we'll probably make it available soon.  I'm hoping to create some more JSON-based pagelets, or see others created once our SDK is released.
</p>
<p>
One thing that's really cool is that <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/common/json.html">Yahoo! is going JSON</a> for many of their services.  Alas, the one that I was hoping to access was their <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/">stock quote service</a>.  They provide CSV feeds of stock data but no JSON yet.  Anybody know how to give them a nudge in the right direction here? :-)
