<h1>It's Hard to Report Tiger Bugs When Apple's Bug Reporter is Broken!</h1>


<p>
I've been using the developer builds of Tiger for a few weeks full-time now, and occasionally I run into bugs that I would like to report to Apple.  But I've been having big problems with their bugreporting system, the one you have to be a member of the Apple Developer Connection to use.

Apparently Apple is working on the issue, but for now they suggest using the reporting form here:  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/bugrptform.html">http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/bugrptform.html</a>.
