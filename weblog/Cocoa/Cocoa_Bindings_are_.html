<h1>Cocoa Bindings are very hard to trace!</h1>


<p>
Our project uses Cocoa Bindings extensively.  This works great, except for when you have a bug.  For instance, you might have something defined in your nib file that doesn't correspond to anything in your model object.  At runtime, you end up with a crash deep in the bowels of the bindings system, with nothing to help you find your way out other than the stack trace which looks like binding-related code of Apple's.  It's completely opaque, of course &mdash; you can't tell what was happening between your code line that was running (say, loading a nib file) and where it has crashed.
</p>
<p>
There needs to be a way to tell what is going on.  Maybe a way to log accesses, or a way to view the parameters being passed around when hunting through the stack traces in XCode's debugger.  I've found a few clues from time to time, but usually it's a lot of work to figure out what went wrong.

Are there any fellow Cocoa developers using Bindings who have come up with tricks and techniquest for diagnosing bindings gone wrong?
