<h1>An Ongoing Conversation</h1>


<p>
As I've gotten back into Cocoa development over the last few months, I haven't spent much time using the Cocoa-specific <a href="http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/cocoa-dev">mailing</a> <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/developer/mailinglists/macosx-dev/">lists</a>.  A lot of newbies, and a lot of noise, so it's hard for somebody who has been around the block with Cocoa to use it to get answers to the inevitable hard questions.  Plus, the time spent waiting for anybody to respond can be frustrating.
</p>
<p>
So I've come up with an idea, and we'll see if the experiment works.  I've set up an IRC channel that experienced cocoa developers can join to post and respond to non-newbie questions.  With minimal chit-chat, and no RTFM questions. (There's an existing "#macdev" channel that I found, but it's a lot of chatter, and very little content, especially Cocoa content, from what I could tell.)
</p>
<p>
We had a few people start late last week, and already we got some useful questions asked and answered, and a few bugs fixed in an open-source framework.  But it needs to have an optimal number of people involved ... too few, and you're not likely to get a response; too many, and it starts wasting everybody's time trying to keep up.
</p>
<p>
So ... if you are an experienced Cocoa developer ... meaning you have been writing Cocoa application(s) for several months, perhaps you have completed or shipped a program already, and you know how to look things up and search Google and the <a href="http://www.cocoabuilder.com/">mamasam</a> archives before bothering other people, then come on by, introduce yourself so we know who you are, and then be on-hand for asking and answering hard questions.  We're #cocojox at irc.freenode.net.
