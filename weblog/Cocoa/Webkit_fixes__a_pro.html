<h1>Webkit fixes: a proposal</h1>


<p>
I'm guessing that my blog has more readers than the weblog over at karelia.com that chronicles the development of my application <a href="http://www.sandvox.com/">Sandvox</a> (in beta), so I wanted to mention this here.  We are trying to get rid of some annoying bugs in WebKit, that, once fixed, will greatly enhance Sandvox.  So we came up with a program to provide an incentive for WebKit hackers to help us get some of these things fixed.  A win-win proposal
