<h1>WebKit: Previous technique doesn't work for all situations</h1>


<p>
The <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/Cocoa/WebKit__Forcing_inc.html">technique I posted to prevent caching</a> isn't all it's cracked up to be.  If you are loading via <code>-[WebFrame loadHTMLString: baseURL:]</code> then it won't work.   The included file is cached by WebCore and there is no way to get around it.  Well, they have filed a bug report (#4082386), at least.
