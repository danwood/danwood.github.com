In defiance of the		ubuquitous yellow "under construction" signs (shouldn't they be orange?)		I have created, and will allow you to use, these icons to indicate that		your web page is <strong>finished</strong>.  This doesn't mean you can't		work on it and improve it; it just means it's something you're proud of		and are prepared to the public.		Copy any of these images below and put them on your web server.<hr>		<a href="not.125.gif"><img HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 width=125 height=125 src="not.125.gif"></a>		<a href="not.100.gif"><img HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 width=100 height=100 src="not.100.gif"></a>		<a href="not.75.gif"><img HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 width=75 height=75 src="not.75.gif"></a>		<a href="not.perspec.gif"><img HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 width=175 height=100 src="not.perspec.gif"></a><br CLEAR=ALL><hr>		All images Copyright &copy; 1995 Dan Wood.
